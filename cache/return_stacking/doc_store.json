Reserves, Liquidity Needs, and Return Stacking[00:00:00] 2023-10-17 14-24-12:In this video, I'm going to show you how you can borrow money at an interest rate substantially lower than you can find at any bank. For investors, cash is an incredibly powerful tool. It provides us with a tremendous amount of flexibility and optionality in our decision making. The problem is when we have too much cash on hand, it can lead to something called cash drag .That's the opportunity cost of returns we could have had if we had invested the cash rather than having it sit idle on the sidelines. So how do we manage this tradeoff? the one hand, wanting the cash for the valuable flexibility it provides us, but on the other hand, not wanting so much cash sitting around that it hurts our long term returns. Let me throw an alternative out there. What if, instead of having cash sit idle on the sidelines, we simply just borrowed cash whenever we needed it? As an example, it's pretty trivial for any investor to head over to any major brokerage [00:01:00] and turn on margin borrowing. Margin borrowing allows you to borrow cash using your assets as collateral. Schwab, TD, Pershing, Fidelity, they all offer this feature. But the interest rates can be pretty steep. For context, U. S. Treasury bill rates today are somewhere around five and a half percent, but if you were to go turn on margin borrowing at any of the major RIA brokerage firms, you would see margin rates somewhere between nine and fourteen percent, depending on how much you're planning to borrow. That's obviously really high and potentially in many cases prohibitively high. But in a minute, we're going to talk about how you can access much, much cheaper borrowing markets. That said, if you need cash in a pinch, it's available. And in fact, in certain scenarios, it may make perfect sense to pay those margin rates if you're just trying to cross a short term cash flow chasm.

And there are other perfectly valid reasons why you might want to borrow cash. For example, a retiree who's taking frequent cash withdrawals from their portfolio may actually be better off borrowing cash in the short term rather than selling stocks and bonds during a bear market particularly if their view is that the market is going to turn around. 1 In these cases, if investors borrow the capital and repaid over time, they are in effect reverse dollar cost averaging. It allows them to significantly reduce the risk of realizing those losses at the worst possible time. So borrowing can make complete sense. The question we can ask is, well, is there a way for us to borrow but at substan- tially lower interest rates? We believe substantially lower rates are available if you're willing to lean into the capital efficient world of derivatives like futures. Now, don't worry to actually implement this idea in practice. [00:03:00] You don't necessarily have to trade the futures contracts, but I do think it's important to understand what's actually happening behind the scenes. As an example, a futures contract on the S& P 500 will provide me with the total return of the S& P 500, but I only have to put up a fraction of the money. If I want 100 of exposure to the S& P 500, I might only have to put up 10 of capital to get that 100 of exposure. Now, because I'm only putting up the 10 of capital, it means I'm implicitly borrowing the other 90. But here's a part that's kind of cool. We're not actually charged an explicit interest rate on that $90 we've borrowed. In other words, there's no interest payment that's due. What actually happens is the interest payment is implicit. It's subtracted from the returns of the futures contract. All right, to make things a little clearer, take a look at this graph. What I've done here is I've plotted the growth of 100 [00:04:00] invested in the S& P 500 versus 100 invested in S& P 500 futures contracts.

cost of financing. And so if we actually measure the difference between these two return streams, what we'll have effectively captured is that embedded cost of financing. In this next graph, I do exactly that. The green line captures the difference in returns. The bands reflect the returns of one to three month U. S. Treasuries, with different constant premiums added on top. And the reason we do this is to see where that green line falls. And we can see that it falls approximately around the return of one to three month U. S. Treasuries plus about a constant 4 percent per year. 2 In other words, that embedded financing cost that we're paying to borrow those 90 has historically been about the yield of 1 3 month U. S. [00:05:00] Treasuries plus a constant 0. 4 percent per year. Let me put that another way. Historically, you got to borrow at the exact same rate as the U.S. Government plus 0.4% per year. All right, wonderful. How does this actually help you? Well, let's say you are a 60 40 investor. 60 percent of your money is in stocks, 40 percent is in bonds. What you could do is you could sell down some of your stocks and replace it with exposure in S& P 500 futures. And you could take the cash that's left over and have it sit in short term U. S. Treasury bills. That T bill return would help offset the cost of financing that exists in those S& P 500 futures. So when you're not using the cash, you're effectively net neutral. But the cash is now available if and when you need it. By the way, if you're enjoying this video, I would really appreciate it if you could hit those like and subscribe buttons.

as with any form of borrowing, this approach is not without its own risks and trade offs. Besides the operational risk of setting this all up and managing it on an ongoing basis, we have to consider that S& P 500 futures typically receive much worse tax treatment than simple buy and hold equities. Here, I'll simply mention that there are treasury futures, and treasury futures, at least as of today, receive somewhat net neutral, if not slightly preferential tax treatment to buy and hold treasuries. So instead of selling equities to buy, say, S& P 500 futures, you could, in theory, sell some bonds and buy treasury futures. But you'll also want to consider things like collateral maintenance. Futures are mark to market daily, which means losses can begin to accrue and start to chew through your collateral if you don't keep enough cash on hand. Now in practice, you don't need to do any of this yourself. There are ETFs and [00:07:00] mutual funds that exist today that will implement this concept for you. 3 Consider, for example, an ETF that for every dollar you invest provides you with 1 of exposure to stocks and 1 of exposure to bonds. If you're a 60 40 investor, you could, in theory, sell 10 percent of your stocks and 10 percent of your bonds and buy 10 percent exposure to this ETF. That remaining 10 percent capital available could be invested in short term T bills ready to deploy whenever you need to draw on it. And when you do deploy it, you're effectively borrowing that money at the incredibly low interest rates embedded in futures markets. Okay. Adult Swim Time. Because once you really internalize this concept, you realize there's all sorts of financing trade offs you can start to make in your life. For example, according to Bankrate. com, the average 30 year fixed mortgage is coming in at 7. 9 percent today. In theory, an investor could sell down some of their stocks and [00:08:00] bonds and replace that exposure with capital efficient instruments like futures and use that cash to increase the down payment on whatever home they're purchasing.

doing so, they're effectively swapping their borrowing rate from the 8 percent mortgage to whatever the rate is embedded in the futures contracts. Now, there are, of course, plenty of trade offs to consider here. For example, we probably don't want to do this if selling those assets is going to create a really large tax liability. Conversely, U. S. investors will want to make sure they fully take into account the tax deductions that are available to them from the mortgage interest payments. . But if we're concerned about cash flow, reducing the mortgage size helps reduce the explicit mortgage payments we have to make and converts them into implicit payments that show up in the returns of our investments. You might also ask yourself, well, what if we take that cash that's available and invest it somewhere else? And that's exactly what we were just discussing with our example in a [00:09:00] house, but you could also consider a variety of other investments. And if you're asking yourself that, you've effectively hit on the core idea of return stacking. With return stacking, we're effectively trying to replace core stock and bond exposure with capital efficient instruments like futures so that we can free up cash and use it to invest in different, hopefully diversifying, alternative asset classes and investment strategies. What this does in effect is it takes the returns of those investments and stacks them on top of our core stocks and bonds minus the cost of financing. 4 And again, this isn't something you have to do explicitly. Pre stack solutions now exist that allow you to tap into this idea without you ever having to manage derivatives yourself.

to Minimize Business Risk Through Better Portfolio Construction Rodrigo:In 1989, inflation in Peru went from 20% to 7,200% and any success that my father and his partners had found in that software company just kind of got turned upside down. Any savings we had, purchasing power went to zero because we had it in Peruvian soles I saw my father try to start business after business. He was very susceptible to the much faster business cycle that emerging markets generally have. And I got to see how his business efforts were closely tied to however Peru was doing at any given time. And so by the time I graduate from the University of Toronto, I knew I didn't want that, right? I knew I didn't want to be exposed to that level of business risk. I didn't want to be tied at the hip to the economic cycle. And so using the numerate skills that my father gave me, I went back as far as I could to try to understand how I could put portfolios together in a more thoughtful way that didn't make me as susceptible to these big crashes. intro:Um, If you're a financial advisor, I'm about to teach you how I apply this rarely used portfolio construction approach that helped me remove the negative impacts of the economic cycle from my own personal business risk and of course my family's financial risk as well. And so what we'll try to do in this video is identify what those risks are and then we'll visualize how these risks have looked like historically based on your client's average portfolio composition. Rodrigo:And we'll do a couple of examples there. And then finally identify how we may be able to fill in some of those blind spots that will help us minimize the disastrous impact that a negative economic cycle can have on both your business and your family. All right, so let's review the five ways that we can feel the wrath of an economic downturn. Now, Corey did cover these in a lot of detail in a recent video that was inspired by Meb Faber's framework, and you can find that right here. But the Coles notes are fairly simple. You know, the first one is in your own personal portfolios.

the market drops, advisors are simply going to feel it just like everybody else. The second one, of course, is in their short term business revenue. Most advisors charge a fee, that is a percentage of client assets under management. And when the market drops, total assets under management drop, and that usually means a drop in revenue as well. The third is long term business revenue. During a prolonged multi year bear market, you and I both know that clients get scared. They don't want to put money to work and oftentimes they withdraw their money altogether. And that will lead to further declines in assets and therefore further declines in revenue. The fourth is for advisors who are part of a much larger organization. 1 If firm revenues fall enough, they might find themselves completely out of a job. And we like to add a fifth element here. And it's with those advisors that own their own business, those independent RIAs. And the way that works is that the value of their equity is usually estimated as a multiple of revenue. So, in a severe bear market that lasts many, many years, with revenue low, the value of the company can drop dramatically as well. So, with all this in mind, what we'll do now is to start by helping you visualize how these risks have looked historically, depending on your average client portfolio. , okay, so let's start with advisors who work predominantly with retirees. Now, this advisor will have a revenue weighted average portfolio that is dominated by fixed income. Volatility and interest rates, which can be caused by things like sudden changes in inflation expectations or volatility. And that's kind of what we're showing you here in this chart, which is a portfolio that's dominated by fixed income. It's 80 percent aggregate bond index and 20 percent global equities. And what's interesting about this is that yes, it's dominated by fixed income, but for the most part, this is a pretty smooth ride. And a interesting twist, the 80 20 split. Puts us in a very well balanced position between two asset classes that are good for a growth and low growth environment. It's like two pistons in a motor working nice and smoothly.

when you do 80 20 with an aggregate bond portfolio that has a duration, average duration of around six years, then it's actually a pretty good match. And that's why the drawdown in 08 and the drawdown in 2020 isn't that bad. Having said that in 2022, this was kind of the Achilles heel of a portfolio that is dominated by fixed income. Right. This is a time when rates go up that quickly. You're going to see equities and bonds go down together. And that is something that we hadn't seen in the previous, literally like 40 years since Volcker broke the back of inflation. And so it's, it's been a bit of a Goldilocks moment for that 80, 20 portfolio. Now we're starting to see the impacts or the negative cyclical economic impacts to our revenue. If we are a investment advisor that focuses on retirees and has a lot of fixed income in the books. All right, now let's go to the other end of the spectrum. Let's focus on advisors who do most of their business with growth clients that will likely see their revenue dominated by equity market risk. In this case, it would be wise for the advisor to plan for a period where the stock market crashes 30, 40, 50 percent and with it firm revenue. So what we're showing you in this graph now is the complete opposite end of the spectrum, right? We're giving 80 percent of our allocation to global equities, 20 percent of allocation to fixed income, and now we can see that we're really tied to that economic cycle, right? That recession cycle, the 2000 2003,'08, we're getting hit, 2020. And then in 2 2022, when rates spiked and there was a compression, In multiples, then you can see that we're going to be susceptible to rate hike in environment as well. So when we look at the landscape of portfolio management and investment advisory services, we really are just seeing somewhere in between those two extremes.

you know, you can see that the character changes slightly, but it's kind of the major ranges that we're going to see in asset management. And while we often argue in this channel that diversification is good for investors, we can also see why diversification would be good for financial advisor business risk, right? In an ideal world, an advisor's revenue weighted average portfolio would be well diversified and be able to weather any market condition, providing significantly more stable revenues for yourself and your family and your business, as we've said a number of times in this video already. Okay. So now we're going to get into filling in some of those blind spots. But before I do, I think it would be useful for me to tell you a little bit about my personal backstory and how I came to view the world of investing the way I do. I was, for those of you who don't know, I was born and raised in Lima, Peru, and I was lucky enough to be the child of a father who was a brilliant mathematician. He was also a software developer. In fact, he was a Naval officer in the Peruvian Navy. He was sent to Monterey, California in the U. S. to study operations research and software development and came back starting to build the first computer that Peru ever had for the Navy. Those kind of punch card type of computers. That's, that's what I'm talking about. That's how far back it goes. And so from that, once he left the Navy, he started a software development company. It was fairly successful. And in 1989, everything turned on its head. In 1989, inflation in Peru went from 20% to 7,200 And any success that my father and his partners had found in that software company just kind of got turned upside down. Any savings we had, purchasing power went to zero because we had it in Peruvian soles and whatever money we had left, we used to emigrate to Toronto, Canada.

real estate with very little money down, almost close to 5 percent last time I spoke with him and what was crazy about that is that we hit the peak of the real estate cycle back in Toronto, where markets did drop 50%, something that I think nobody believes can happen again. We felt it. by the time we sold the house in the mid nineties, we were down 30%. So we had recovered a little bit from the bottom and we had to do that because we were going back to Peru. So once in Peru, I saw my father try to start a business after business. He was very susceptible to the much faster business cycle that emerging markets generally have. And I got to see how his business efforts were closely tied to however Peru was 3 doing at any given time. I finally left Peru to go to the University of Toronto, where I stayed with my brother who was working as an accountant at KPMG. And he showed me his statements throughout the tech crisis while I was still in university and said that he had just gotten absolutely slammed by his exposure to tech stocks. And so by the time I graduate from the University of Toronto, I knew I didn't want that, right? I knew I didn't want to be exposed to that level of business risk. I didn't want to be tied at the hip to the economic cycle. And so using the numerate skills that my father gave me, I went back as far as I could to try to understand how I could put portfolios together in a more thoughtful way that didn't make me as susceptible to these big crashes. And when you're going back that far, you're really not there trying to pick stocks and pick bonds and individual stocks, individual bonds. What you're trying to do is identify the big muscle movements that are going to get you to safety and kind of get you out of the way. And the discovery was fairly simple. You want equities for bull markets. You want exposure to sovereign bonds for non inflationary bear markets. And then you want some exposure to commodities and gold.

different options was the managed future space because, when you compare the different areas of the hedge fund industry, what you should be looking for are not more equity exposure, but at a lower volatility, which tends to be the case for these long, short equity managers, there weren't a lot of market neutral managers back then that I was able to get a hold of. But what I was able to find was managed futures managers that really have a unique sandbox to play in. They can diversify across dozens and dozens of markets from equity, global equity market indices, to global sovereign bond indices to currencies, as well as a wide variety of commodities. And so that really covers the gamut of diversity that I could get my hands on. And moreover, they could go long and short those things. Now the most popular style that we use in managed futures is trend following. Now, it's not the only one. We're going to make a video on all the different types of Styles that one can invest in with managed futures, global macro, and so on in another video. But if we focus on the trend portfolio, it was a very interesting offering, because over the period that I had examined, it had zero correlation, or very close to zero correlation to both equities and bonds over the long term. Now, because these mandates have the ability to be net long everything, net short everything, and net neutral everything, That was more of a conditional correlation. We can be correlated to equities and bonds when they were working, they could be negatively correlated to bonds and equities when they were not working, or they can be somewhere in the middle, somewhere neutral, right? So it really fit in for me, what the big blind spots I saw in those economic cycles that the average investment advisor that I had interviewed for work at the time was doing. 4 And so I started incorporating managed futures into client portfolios when I first got into the business and had the opportunity to start running money. So what we're going to do now is I'm going to show you what I saw back then in hopes that it inspires you to do things differently, to take that red pill and take a different approach.

different approach. All right, so let's start with this next chart. . just shows the traditional conservative portfolio that I showed you before of 80 percent fixed income, 20 percent equities. And you can see that it's kind of nice and smooth and then drops off in 2022, This green line at the top, , what I've done here is made a very simple modification. I've simply added a third asset class, which is the SOC Gen Trend Index. I'm not doing anything special about the proper weighting scheme between equities, bonds, and managed futures here. I'm introducing you to a concept here, right? And I often like to use the idea of a three piston motor. Well, the majority of the investment landscape just uses two pistons, And in the black line , we have a bond piston that is really thick, an equity piston that is really thin. And so we had, the car is going to move forward largely on that bond piston. Moving us forward and when the bond piston is down, we're going to get hurt, right? So... What I'm doing now here is introducing a third piston, and we're making them equal dollar weights here. So we're trying to make those pistons a little bit of the same size. And we want to have that third piston to be able to go up when maybe equities and bonds go down together. And we see this, the benefit of this in the year of 2022, you can see the tail end of this chart shows a much smoother ride. We, we kind of minimize that sequence of return risk that we are all susceptible to, especially if you're a retiree, And when we compare the prior experience from 2000 to 2022, we see that it's very similar to that 80 20 portfolio. That kind of adverse scenario risk is smoothed out in'08, in 2000 and 2020. Okay? So this is what I mean by adding that diversifier and it seems, and we're not doing anything special here, right?

things. What we're doing is simply putting an equal weight portfolio of three structurally diversified strategies together. And oftentimes, we like to say that diversification done properly is indistinguishable from magic, but it is that simple. Okay. So now moving on to the moderate risk portfolio, this blue line here is a 50 percent equity, 50 percent bond portfolio. And while it may seem like it's an equal risk portfolio, the reality is that The 50 percent inequities dominates the risk. And so you still see that susceptibility to the economic cycle that you see much less of in that green line 5 So. Again, the green line is an equal weight portfolio, a third, a third, a third between those three asset classes. The only thing that we're doing different here is we're expanding the gross exposure to have 40 percent equity, 40 percent bonds, and 40 percent managed futures trend. And so we're adding a 20 percent stack on top of managed futures trend in order to maintain the proportions. maintain that kind of smooth equity line or smoother equity line. But now we're increasing the volatility and increasing the drawdowns that you would experience in contrast to a non stacked one third, one third, one third portfolio. Okay. So this is now increasing the risk for a moderate risk investor. If we move on to a growth oriented investor and investor base, The traditional way to do this is to now skew very much into equities, 80 percent equities, 20 percent bonds. And now we're fully susceptible to the economic cycle. And we are going to be managing a lot of emotions in short periods of time. But also, you know, it feels good to be up when there's a prolonged multi year bull market that you can take advantage of. Having said that, again, what we're looking to do here is to smooth out our risk in the business cycle, our clients risks, and so on. So by having that third, third, third portfolio, but now what we're doing is we're giving 50 percent to equities, 50 percent to bonds, and 50 percent to manage futures trend in order to increase the

to manage futures trend in order to increase the return that is required for that client base. But also you're increasing the volatility, you're increasing the drawdowns, and the risk in contrast to the previous two portfolios. So putting them all together, what we can see here is that we've accomplished our goal of bucketing different portfolios for different risk buckets. Our conservative mandates get lower volatility and lower drawdown. Our aggressive mandates get higher volatility and higher drawdowns. But ultimately, the adverse scenario risk remains kind of similar across the three different buckets, we've stretched out that equity line. We've reduced the business cycle risk, . And we've created a set of portfolios that really meets those traditional needs of risk bucketing across all of our client base. Now what's obvious here is that in order to do this, you need to have access to , professionally managed, and cheap leverage. And while that wasn't available to me back in the 2000s directly in public products like ETFs and mutual funds, I had to go out and find the hedge fund managers, convince them to create a private pool in Canada, put the private pool together, seed the private pool, and I could only offer it to accredited investors at the time. Today, all of that has completely changed. We now have a wide variety of exchange traded funds and mutual funds that come with pre packaged stacks that will allow us to get access to well managed, cheap leverage and put these type of portfolios together. 6 And so, just what have we actually done with those three buckets? We've created, the first portfolio doesn't require any stacking at all, right? It's a third, a third, a third. You just diversify. The second portfolio is 40, 40, 40, which means that you're gonna have to find a 20 percent managed futures stack somewhere in order to, to have that expanded canvas, that expanded growth exposure. And then the third one is 50, 50, 50, so you're gonna have to find a way to get that extra 50 percent exposure to managed futures trend.

different client personas means that advisors and their clients are finally well aligned. And when we talk about alternative investment strategies and how you can use techniques like the ones above and return stacking to introduce them into your portfolio, it's not because they're inherently good. But because diversification is inherently good, it's called the only free lunch on Wall Street because combining non correlated assets into a portfolio, you can now have wealth that compounds at greater consistency. So, if you're a financial advisor, finding ways to introduce diversification into a client's portfolio not only has a possibility of improving the resilience of the financial plan, but also the stability of your business. So, I hope this was useful to you and really taking that red pill of diversification. I know we didn't have access to these things. Really, our only choices... For the last 10, 15, 20 years had really been to be heavily weighted towards equities and heavily weighted towards bonds or leaning on equity managers to pick better stocks to try to manage some of the risk to the downside. But that's no longer the case. We now have the solutions in place. So if you liked what you heard in this video please do smash that like button and subscribe to the channel so that you can be abreast of any other videos that we put out in the future. Also, if you have any comments, please put them down below. We like to interact with our audience. We like to be told when we're wrong, or when you like what we have to say, or when you don't like what we have to say. Let's start a dialogue. And finally, if you want to reach out directly to us, you can go to returnstack. com, where we have a wide variety of tools that will help you visualize the benefits of Return stacking, we have a portfolio visualizer tool and a safe withdrawal rate visualizer tool that'll help you kind of understand what different stacks and different diversifiers can do in terms of improving that outcome for your clients and your business.

you're a Successful Financial Advisor you got LUCKY Rodrigo\\\\:. okay, I'm probably going to say something that's quite controversial. If you've been a very successful financial advisor as of 2022, then you probably got really lucky. And this video is really about the business risk for your financial future as an advisor, as a business owner, as an entrepreneur. We don't want to get too lucky. We don't want to get too unlucky. We actually want to place the odds in our favor. . So if you're into that idea, then stick around and we'll get right into it. Um, so what today's topic is about is tracking error risk and line item risk. , these are real behavioral things that we need to address to make sure that we keep our clients.

The rest of their line items that they question, whether that should be in their portfolio in spite of all the future diversification benefits that they might offer, right? . , so we definitely need to be sensitive to tracking error risk and line item risk, right? The most perfect diversified portfolio doesn't matter. If your clients can stick to it. So I'm sympathetic to the path that we've taken thus far. Because the idea of having to make room in your portfolio in order to add those diversifiers as. Largely been unpalatable, right? So look, . I'm going to create a fictitious advisor. She is coming off of the 2000 to 2010 period. And she looks back at a fantastic diversifier.

futures managers that focus on trend following exclusively, and they can go long and short. All global markets, all global sovereign bond markets, a wide variety of commodity markets , and they can go long and short. So you can kind of be sure that they're going to be non correlated to your traditional equities and bonds. And, , because a trend is your friend over time, not all the time, but over time, what's going to happen is. In periods of really crystallized trends to the downside inequities, you will be able to benefit. And historically, this index has shown to benefit in bear markets and so on. So really low correlation, , it's designed to have an absolute return profile over a full market cycle. , it checks all of the boxes for a diversified solution. So this particular advisor, it's 2010, she looks back to 2000 to 2010 and sees large outperformance of the SocGen Trend Index analyzing at 8% when the 1 Vanguard Balance Fund did really poorly around 2.6%. And by looking at that and seeing how non-correlated it was, how it filled in the gaps during prolonged multi-year bear markets in the two thousands and 2008. And then looks at the correlation data and sees that it has a correlation of negative 0. 2. She recognizes this is it. I need to add this to my portfolio. I'm going to make room in that portfolio, sell some of my bonds, sell some of my equities, add this. And of course, it couldn't have come at a worse time because The next decade is a complete flipping of the equation. What she sees is that the SOCGEN trend index annualizes at 1. 7 total return, , and that the Vanguard balance fund actually did 9. 2%. Now, the correlation is still fantastic at 0. 22, a slight positive correlation because trend following is following trends in certain markets. In this decade, it was mostly dominated by domestic U.

one is, is business risk. You're probably not growing as fast. You are probably losing clients and, and you're probably having a tough time acquiring new clients. And the second one is reputational risk. You know, we know that financial advisors will grow their business a lot by referrals. And if your clients had a terrible time, number one, they're unlikely to add more assets. And number two, they're unlikely to recommend you, so this pressure from the business risk that she took and, losing some clients and maybe some credibility led her to completely blow out that position, . Of course, at the wrong time, if , in 2022, she blows out the position goes 100%, 60, 40. Well, I think we, we all know what happened. We had a massive inflationary thrust that led to rates going higher than we'd seen them in a couple decades. This leads to both equities and bonds to go down together. So high correlation to equities and bonds, a prolonged multi-month bear market in both equities and bonds at the same time. And it just so happens that the Trend Index that can short bonds and can go long commodities and short, some equities benefited from that environment, providing double digit returns from 2020 to the second quarter of 2023. So again, just bad timing. So if we take the whole period, if we take a step back and really analyze the performance of the balance fund against this trend index, we find that we got to the same place just in different ways. So the promise of diversification was there. It's just that the tracking error bias and the line item risk were just too much. So this is why I'm so excited about the concept of return stacking. And I truly think that it could revolutionize the way. Portfolio managers, investment advisors, institutions, corporations that can't get access to direct derivatives can benefit from.

we can identify exchange traded funds and mutual funds that are profes- sionally managed. That already offer different types of stacks for every dollar you give these funds, you're going to get a dollar of something and a dollar of something else, whether it's equity stack with bonds or equity stack with trend or bonds stack with trend or systematic global macro, you know, there's a wide variety and we can help you identify which, but going back to this particular example, let's go use the SOCGEN trend index and see what the experience would have been like. Okay. with a stack rather than making room, so instead of saying this or that, we are trying to say, yes, have your 6040 and stack these returns on top. I'm gonna ignore the 2000 to 2010 period. I really wanna zero in on that really tough period of 2010 to 2020 where, , SocGen Trend Index really did low single digits for a full decade. Now, normally that would be cause for consternation, but again, , by stacking things on top, if we're able to stack an extra 50% of the SOC gen trend index on top of the 60 40, Rodrigo\\\\:and what you can see here in this bar chart is that, the vanguard balance fund annualized at 9. 6%, and then the excess returns of the SocGen trend index that we can stack on top actually added to the P& L, added to performance, an extra 65 basis points. That's 10. 25. Percent. Okay. So all of a sudden, something that seemed really bad has actually inched us closer to a more successful business. It's, it's helped the advisor not only maintain their clients and giving them the tracking, , to a benchmark that they want, but also outperform our competition . So this next graph shows the actual client experience in a much clearer way. That line that's kind of going down and to the right is the accumulated tracking error that you would have experienced if you had a portfolio that made a third of the investment in the alternative and reduce your 60 40 exposure by 33%, right?

a constant point of consternation for clients and, clients being disappointed about the outcomes. The top line is what happens when you stack that diversifier on top? Yes, there is going to be some differences. Yes, there might be a little bit of tracking error, but wildly different and significantly smaller than what you would have otherwise. Okay? So again, the stacking helps not only for the full decade, but also throughout , the decade, to help diversify and minimize tracking error. This is where I really wanted to get to, which is what happened from 2020 to 2023. Q2 2023 is that we had an inflationary thrust, we had a bear market in 3 equities, we had equities and bonds going down. How did trend do? Well, as you can see from this bar chart, it managed to stack an extra 5. 15% of excess returns on top of your balance fund. A total return for the client of 10. 55 and a significantly lower volatility portfolio. So, again, this is, this is the value. You have it there when you need it. And then in the 2010s when you didn't, , need it and it didn't work so well, it wasn't that bad. And it kept the tracking error low. Rodrigo\\\\:So if we step back to the 10, 000 foot view and we look at the period from 2000 all the way to Q2 2023, we find that this solution tends to be a more attractive outcome. You see a much straighter equity line, it seems to provide better outcomes. During the period of 2000 to 2003, the period of oh eight, the credit crisis, even during the Covid crisis, , it offered a little bit of help and certainly in 2022. Throughout all this time, you're not bringing , your line item risk to zero. You're not bringing your tracking error risk to zero, but you're certainly, I think, reducing it enough where you can give your clients what they need, in spite of what they want.

the moral of this story is that if you're one of those advisors that feels got lucky, , that kind of got into the business at the right time, benefited from Meta and NVIDIA and all the fangs and, and the domestic equities , that were kind of floated by those markets, , then return stacking provides the ability to continue to offer your clients what they're used to, but just stacking that extra protection on top, that extra diversity that both helps you and your business. Because if, if history is any indication, you will compound at a higher rate, but you won't necessarily compound at a higher risk. you see from these charts you have a lower drawdown. . It protects during the two blind spot periods that a balance fund seems to have, which is inflation periods and bear markets. So, you know, this is an opportunity really to now, now to shift into these diversifiers before your great luck over the last decade turns into really bad luck. So I hope you understand what I was trying to do with this video, right? I'm not saying you got lucky. I know that it took, if you're one of those advisors, it takes a lot of hard work, regardless of market environments, to really build a strong book of business, strong, loyal clients. , we do have to accept that there was some luck if indeed you're dominated by domestic equities and bonds.

RSST 3Q in 3M Invest ReSolve What is the investment objective? The Return Stacked U.S. Stocks and Managed Futures ETF seeks long term capital appreciation with an aim to provide investors with an efficient exposure to a large-cap U. S. Equity basket while stacking a Managed Futures strategy on top. In other words, for every dollar invested, the ETF will aim to simultaneously provide a full dollar of large-cap U.S. Equity exposure and another full dollar to a Managed Futures trading strategy. The equity portion of the strategy will be sub advised by newfound research. While Resolve will be the trading advisor for the Managed Futures Trend Strategy, which invests in 27 highly liquid, exchange traded futures among four asset classes. Commodities, Currencies, Equities, and Fixed Income. Why now? While the Managed Futures category has historically exhibited very low correla- tion to both stocks and bonds, while achieving a competitive rate of return over a full market cycle. So for example, if you look at the Stock Gen CTA Index, What you'll find is that it has two very important characteristics. Number one, it has historically provided positive returns during prolonged and multi year bear markets. And number two, it has historically exhibited inflation hedging characteristics. Now today, we continue to see challenges for traditional portfolios. Given the ongoing geopolitical turmoil, an uncertain rate environment, stretched equity valuations, and rising inflation volatility, All of these imply depressed returns and higher potential volatility for traditional portfolios. Now, we believe that a thoughtful allocation to manage futures can help investors navigate this environment in a much more robust manner. How should I utilize this product in my portfolio allocation? When allocating to manage futures, one of the greatest challenges investors face is how do I make room in my portfolio? Particularly during a decade like the 2010s when equities and bonds were soaring and managed futures returns were eking out single digit returns. RSST seeks to solve this problem by allowing investors to pursue diversification without sacrificing core stock exposure. So how do we do this?

and the other half in managed futures. By replacing a portion of your equity holdings with RSST, investors can seek to maintain their domestic Equity exposure while stacking managed futures on top. In other words, you're not sacrificing your base asset allocation at all. You are merely adding a new, additional diversifier and the commensurate, non correlated returns that come with it over time. Even during the 2010 period of 1 middling managed futures returns as a stack, the extra return would have been a welcome addition. No more compromises. We are taking a yes and approach to portfolio construc- tion. We believe return stacked ETFs will ultimately help minimize fear of missing out while possibly enhancing returns to portfolios, all the while managing risk better to thrive in the challenging markets ahead.

is derived from that of other assets, rates, or indices. The use of derivatives for non-hedging purposes may be considered to carry more risk than other types of investments. Cayman Subsidiary Risk: By investing in the Fund’s Cayman Subsidiary, the Fund is indirectly exposed to the risks associated with the Subsidiary’s investments. The futures contracts and other investments held by the Subsidiary are subject to the same economic risks that apply to similar investments if held directly by the Fund. The Subsidiary is not registered under the 1940 Act, and, unless otherwise noted in the Fund’s Prospectus, is not subject to all the investor protections of the 1940 Act. 2 Commodity Risk: Investing in physical commodities is speculative and can be extremely volatile. Equity Market Risk:By virtue of the Fund’s investments in equity securities, equity ETFs, and equity index futures agreements, the Fund is exposed to equity securities both directly and indirectly which subjects the Fund to equity market risk. Common stocks are generally exposed to greater risk than other types of securities, such as preferred stock and debt obligations, because common stockholders generally have inferior rights to receive payment from specific issuers. Equity securities may experience sudden, unpredictable drops in value or long periods of decline in value. This may occur because of factors that affect securities markets generally or factors affecting specific issuers, industries, or sectors in which the Fund invests. Commodity-Linked Derivatives Tax Risk: The tax treatment of commodity- linked derivative instruments may be adversely affected by changes in legislation, regulations, or other legally binding authority. As a registered investment company (RIC), the Fund must derive at least 90% of its gross income each taxable year from certain qualifying sources of income under the Internal Revenue Code. If, as a result of any adverse future legislation, U.S. Treasury regulations, and/or guidance issued by the Internal Revenue Service, the income of the Fund from certain commodity-linked derivatives,

Fund level. The uncertainty surrounding the treatment of certain derivative instruments under the qualification tests for a RIC may limit the Fund’s use of such derivative instruments. Commodity Pool Regulatory Risk:The Fund’s investment exposure to futures instruments will cause it to be deemed to be a commodity pool, thereby subjecting the Fund to regulation under the Commodity Exchange Act and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission rules. Because the Fund is subject to additional laws, regulations, and enforcement policies, it may have increased compliance costs which may affect the operations and performance of the Fund. Credit Risk: Credit risk refers to the possibility that the issuer of a security will not be able to make principal and interest payments when due. Changes in an issuer’s credit rating or the market’s perception of an issuer’s creditworthiness may also affect the value of the Fund’s investment in that issuer. Currency Risk: Currency risk is the risk that changes in currency exchange rates will negatively affect securities denominated in, and/or receiving revenues in, foreign currencies. The liquidity and trading value of foreign currencies could be affected by global economic factors, such as inflation, interest rate levels, and trade balances among countries, as well as the actions of sovereign governments and central banks. Foreign and Emerging Markets Risk:Foreign and emerging market investing involves currency, political and economic risk. 3 Leverage Risk:As part of the Fund’s principal investment strategy, the Fund will make investments in futures contracts to gain long and short exposure across four major asset classes (commodities, currencies, fixed income, and equities). These derivative instruments provide the economic effect of financial leverage by creating additional investment exposure to the underlying instrument, as well as the potential for greater loss. Non-Diversification Risk:The Fund is non-diversified, meaning that it is permitted to invest a larger percentage of its assets in fewer issuers than diversified funds. Underlying ETFs Risk: The Fund will incur higher and duplicative expenses because it invests in bond ETFs. The Fund may also suffer losses due to the investment practices of the underlying bond ETFs.

 00:01:41  Happy Friday, gents. Rodrigo:  00:01:43  All right. Happy Friday. What a day we have.  Mike:  00:01:47  Cheers.  Rodrigo:  00:01:47  Cheers. Were we all out last night together? We’re all drinking water, or is that a gin tonic, Mike? Mike:  00: 01:54  I too am, yes, I was partaking in a bit of drink. And thus, I’m taking a day off to recover, if you will. But hopefully ... Rodrigo: 00:02:09  We are at our sharpest today. Yes. Adam:  00:02:11  Remember the time when we could recover in like a matter of hours. And now it’s like that recovery time is measured in days, sometimes weeks. Mike:  00: 02:20  Yes. I’m familiar with that. Rodrigo:  00:02:21  I got visitors here and they want to go out for a night of dancing. And I woke up this morning and I said to my wife, do I actually have to go out two nights in a row?

Mike:  00: 02:40  Remember the days where it was you knew where you were going on Tuesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday? Rodrigo:  00:02:46  Barely.  Mike:  00:02:47  Oh my God, anyway. Well, before we get started, let’s give everybody the typical disclaimer that we’re going to have a wide ranging conversation covering lots of stuff and it’s not investment advice. It’s maybe educational and an opportunity to learn, and thus not investment advice.

else, I guess. And with that, I think we’re going to talk about inflation. And one of the things, I noticed one of the inflation memes that was really interesting from the Super Bowl was 50 Cent and his inflation that he’s incurred over the last couple of decades. Going ... Adam: 00:03:32  I saw that 50 Cents to $2, to a buck 50. Mike:  00:03:36  Yeah, buck 50. I do love that. And then the ensuing hubbub about who do those rap singers belong to, the Millennial generation or the Gen X.  Rodrigo: 00:03:49  It was fascinating. I was at a Super Bowl party that spanned the ages and you could just see the Boomers were like, that was the worst Super Bowl halftime show I’ve ever seen in my entire life. As like, guys my age are tweeting out like that was the greatest Super Bowl party ever, ever hands down, amazing. And we’re just all making fun of each other because it was just pure honesty, right? Like, if you didn’t live it, you aren’t going to like it. Adam: 00:04:18  Well, it was pretty cheeky, actually for the Super Bowl organizers to skip right over Gen X last year. You know, it was like 30 years of Boomer-oriented halftime shows, they skipped right over the Millennials last year with the weekend. And then I guess they remembered that Gen X... Mike:  00: 04:36  Well, this is the thing, right? This is the tension because the Gen X, I mean clearly all of those singers are born in the Gen X era, that 19 sort of 65 to 1980 era and the millennials also claiming them as that’s our generation’s music. And the Gen Xers are like, here we go again. We go straight from Boomers to the Millennials and us Xers are left with -- there was no music for us.

Dre. But yeah, I certainly thoroughly enjoyed it. And it spoke to some of my formative years. But anyway, that’s ... Why Inflation? Rodrigo:  00:05:16  Anyway, inflation everywhere, inflation everywhere, 50 Cent, and dominating the Google searches these days. So, we thought we’d talk a little bit about it. So, Adam, you want to set it up? Why are we talking about inflation just generally? What’s Causing Inflation? Adam:  00:05:35  Well, we’ve had some of the highest CPI prints year over year in decades just in the last few quarters. And obviously markets, and both equities and bonds are finally reacting to this uptick in inflation. Strangely, we aren’t seeing inflation expectations priced in further out on the curve. If you look at five-year, five-year breakevens, they really just haven’t budged. So, I don’t think investors are pricing in sustained inflation, which is interesting, given I was listening to Vincent Deluard talk about a large study on historical inflationary periods that he conducted. He went and curated inflation data from dozens of countries over the last few 100 years. And so he’s got thousands of country years of inflation data as his sample. And his finding was that once inflation ticks above 5%, for a couple of quarters in a row, five years from now, inflation is still five, greater than 5%.  So, once you sort of move into a higher inflation regime, then those get embedded both mechanically, in the fact that companies are now feeling comfortable about raising prices, cost of living is going up, that means that employees are demanding higher wages, so it gets priced into wages. And then finally it gets priced into the expectations, the adaptive expectations, and people begin to believe that inflation will persist for a long time. We’re clearly seeing sort of -- people are still in the transitory phase right now. And we’ll start to see a shift one way or another in the longer term inflation expectations.

the five-year, five-years and see what plays out there. But I mean, clearly, what’s happened here is in reaction to the March 2020 lockdowns, governments fire hosed trillions of dollars like directly into people’s bank accounts. People paid off credit cards and unleashed a buying spree. So, that’s one side of the coin.  T he other side of the coin is that, at the same time, people were flush with spending money, full economies and production lines were shut down around the globe. And so you’ve got too much demand and too little supply. And that’s of course, being complicated even further by the fact that we’re moving into a deglobalization phase. So, globalization, obviously highly disinflationary as you’re able to migrate labor overseas. So, all of the manufacturing gets cheaper and cheaper and cheaper, as the jurisdictions with cheap labor are able to continue to bring prices lower and lower, lower until that was exhausted largely in 2017 when China flipped its energy policy. And so now we’re beginning to see deglobalization and actual repricing at the corporate level and at the employment level. And so we’re entering a very different regime here. So, I think that’s what motivates a timely conversation about inflation. Mike:  00: 09:21  Right. So, we’ve got kind of a combination of both demand and supply shocks happening sort of simultaneously, combined with some pretty significant monetary inflation that in this case, unlike sort of that 08 or sort of the last commodity boom in that early 00s to 08, which was oh, there’s this money being printed and it’s all going to get into the system. It never really did. Global growth was enough to offset whatever inflation was occurring. It wasn’t actually getting through the system, but today and the largess and the different type of monetary interactions, along with some complicating factors around supply chains and demand shocks, you’re starting to see actual inflation manifesting right through to the end user, the end individual and companies and supply chains and things like that.

So, it seems to be quite a sea change.  Adam:  00:10:22  It’s worthwhile I think contrasting to 2008 because I think all three of us were guilty of observing the unprecedented monetary stimulus that was perpetrated by central banks in 2008 and 2009 in response to the global financial crisis. I remember perceiving at the time that the mechanics were going to be a massive increase in M2, banks flush with reserves, and it’s going to unleash a major lending boom. And that would then drive inflation. Turns out all of that stimulus was contained within the financial economy and never really trickled down into the real economy. And so what ended up happening is that you had capital restructuring of corporations, was sort of the primary reaction function to that, right.  So, companies went out, they borrowed a lot at low rates, but instead of ramping up productive capacity, or making large capital investments, instead, they went to the debt market, borrowed, and then used that to buy back shares or issue dividends or whatever. So, you had this sort of -- it enabled this 10 years of financial engineering, right, was very, very good for the capital owners, but didn’t really do much for the real economy. And now we’ve got real money in real peoples’ bank accounts driving real demand at the same time, as you have these interesting supply shock dynamics unfolding. So, yeah, I think we’ve entered a different regime. Rod, you’re muted. Mike:  00:12:04  You’re muted, Rod. Rodrigo:  00:12:09  Sorry, guys. Yeah, I think we talked about this last week, but the real demand is actually quantified by an extra 20% demand on the ports, right. So, this supply chain issue that we’re seeing has come from the demand side for the most part. Ports just haven’t seen that level of increased demand in the last 20 years.

increase their income based on labor demand. So, this is one of the -- another one of the key drivers that is really manifesting today in the CPI numbers. But there’s also the other side, which is what about the long term deflationary impetus, right, the fact that we have continued improvement in technology, the demographics. The other side of the equation is that this is only momentary. People are going to go back to work, they’re going to start buying less stuff, the fiscal spend is going to be that much. And at the end of the day, this is transitory. By the end of the year, we should be back to normal and Bob’s your uncle, right? Mike:  00: 13:18  Population plays a role in that as well. So, population growth, demographics, debt, and the technology, sort of... And I think technology plays a role, longer term, but it’s going to take a while. So, you’ve got wages, which are very, very sticky, it’s hard to roll back wages. And so you’re going to see companies, I think, looking at automation, autonomous driving, all those types of efforts, in order to control costs and reduce costs, but are going to take time to work through the system. You have to retrain a different labor force, you have to implement that technology, you have to build it, you have to build the software side, you have to engineer it, you have to build the hardware side of it. It is a much, I think, a much longer process to actually achieve what might be fruitful in gains that can offset some of the wages. So, it’s pretty interesting.  Th e other thing, and I know, we want to talk about the concept of inflation, but also inflation volatility, right? So, there’s that there’s the mean rate of inflation, and then there’s variants around that mean rate. And those are very important concepts to sort of separate a little bit. And a lot of folks are talking about the 70s as the analogous period.

I think that it’s a little bit narrow-sighted to do that. And the example that we’ve all talked about on multiple occasions is that post World War II scenario where price controls were rescinded from a war economy. And in 1946 was that the first piece of that where these price controls were removed, and we had this burst of inflation, and then a new equilibrium, and then another burst and a new equilibrium.  And so it wasn’t just the inflation rate was increasing, it was this larger variance around the mean that provided more uncertainty with respect to these two dynamics that have a lot of play in asset class pricing, which are inflation and growth, obviously, liquidity playing a role too. But that inflation expectation, having a larger variance has significant impact for asset classes. And there’s that great piece from Man that we’ll be sharing. But we haven’t had inflation volatility or inflation, per se, since sort of 1990. So, we’re at 30 years of extremely low inflation, and a very, very consistent and low volatility around that mean. And I think that bears significant consideration as well as you think about this. End Miniriff here The Types of Inflation Varying Kinds of Inflation Rodrigo:  00:15:57  So, you just kind of addressed a bunch of specific situations around inflation. And there’s another thing, the definition of inflation is so wide varying, right? What is inflation? I know, Adam, you’ve written a bit on this, but what are the different types of inflation that we mean when we mean inflation? Adam:  00:16:16  Well, yeah. So, there’s sort of supply shock inflation, where something happens, think about the oil embargo, and the Iranian revolution in the 70s, obviously, restricting the flow of oil, and therefore the price of oil skyrocketed and triggered broad price increases through the economy, because virtually everything that’s manufactured requires energy. So, that’s kind of the traditional supply end.

that today in combination with supply led inflation, right.  You have a major shock upward in aggregate demand as a function of governments expanding very sizable deficits. Again, like Mike said, we have major deficit spending during wartime, I want to say four years in a row of 15%, or higher deficits as a percent of GDP during wartime, the last couple of years, we’ve seen 12-13% of GDP in deficit spending. So, that just leads to a major demand shock. And in combination with a little supply, that leads to too much money chasing too little production and a rise in the price level.  And then there’s monetary inflation, where governments devalue their currency by directly printing more money into the system. And other countries lose faith in the purchasing power of that currency, and they begin to sell it and the people that are in the economy begin to move away from using the country’s unit of currency, and start denominating trade in the currency of other countries or barter, that sort of thing, right. And I know as we’ll talk about, there are different asset class reaction functions, each of those different types of inflation. So, there’s no single portfolio panacea that solves the problem of all types of inflation. Mike:  00: 18:26  Right. You need a broad swath of opportunities as you look through history, how each inflationary cycle manifested and changed. Even the 70s sought several different types of inflation manifest during that sort of very, very memorable stagflationary time period. And within that longer time period, there was actually lots going on where oil didn’t do so well for a while, but other forms of inflationary hedges did. And so it behooves asset allocators and investors to really think that through because you don’t want to buy an inflation hedge. And I see in the comments, some folks talking about yeah, gold and TIPS really kind of worked over this period. And yeah, there’s just different things that are at play in the asset models. Go ahead.

gold actually worked pretty well from the bottom of the commodity -- of the COVID crisis to the end of the year, because rates went from being relatively positive to negative, right. So that, gold tends to do well when real rates are going to the downside. That happened. That was a phase of inflation. Then came lumber, then came energies, right. So, over the last two years, we’ve seen inflation manifest with different commodities.  You know, TIPS is an interesting one because everything I’m reading about TIPS and what we’ve seen in terms of inflationary regime, they really don’t do anything but just keep your purchasing power. They don’t do anything outside of real returns. Right? So, maybe that’s its job. That’s what it is designed to do, as an offset to your portfolio, to the things that are losing money in real terms and may not be great. And so we got to, as we go through these -- the data and what has done well, in the past, I think we have to be cognizant of the fact that what has done best in the past as like the number one inflation hedge, may not be what is going to do best in the future. So, do we want to kind of bring up those asset classes first, or we want to talk about kind of the framework? End miniriff here Competing Cross-Dynamics Adam:  00:20:37  No, I think ... to sort of summarize a little bit, right, I mean, Mike and I kind of laid out the current inflation case, more sustained inflation, right. I would maybe add as well, a decade or more of profound underinvestment in transition energy and material sources, right. Like, a massive amount of underinvestment in the development of new oil and gas properties. You know, nobody wants to burn coal anymore, which is great. But that was a cheap source of abundant energy.

as you go through the annual reports of the major energy companies, they’re all saying we’re not investing because under the climate targets, any investments we’re going to make in oil and gas will run counter to the objective to hold temperatures to a rise of 1.5% by 2050. So, there’s these competing cross dynamics. The problem being yes, we need a sustainable future, and yes, we should be investing in clean tech. But we need to have enough clean tech online in order to be able to replace what we’re losing from underinvestment in traditional sources of energy in the meantime, right? So, anyways, just to sort of encapsulate, that’s kind of the sustained inflation picture.  But then Rodrigo laid out some points that might lead you to think that this inflation is actually quite transitory. And by the end of the year, early next year, we could be in a disinflationary environment again, right. Another reason we could be in a disinflationary environment is the Fed is not standing pat here, right? The governments of the world are concerned about the fact that we are seeing these high inflation prints, and they are taking steps to counter it. Central banks look like they’re behind the curve, they’re going to step in and they’re going to raise rates over the next few months. If they raise them too aggressively, maybe that causes the economy to stall, demand to stall, we go into recession, and a deflationary environment. Maybe the government institutes price controls or profit controls on companies.  I was just reading over the last couple of days, the Washington Post just had an article out about how the Democrats have been polling and the concept of price caps or corporate profit controls are polling extremely positively. And so while the Council of Economic Advisers in Washington are not yet advocating for this, and in fact, they’re pushing back against it, and I think we would all agree those policies have a lot of potential problems, these are the types of steps that are being considered.

all these things are on the table for the first time in decades. And probably we’re going to see all of them at some point over the next 10 or 20 years. We’re going to see rocking inflation like we are now, maybe even worse, and for longer. At the same time we’re going to see major periods of deflation as governments and other dynamics play into this and swamp the inflation dynamic for a period. So, like Mike said, we need to prepare for different types of inflation and a lot more volatility in the inflation-deflation dynamic. End Miniriff here Mike:  00:24:46  Yeah. I’d love to poll the audience here. Type in one if you’re in the inflation sustained camp that, hey, this inflation is here, it’s more permanent. Throw in a two if you think the inflation remains sort of transitory, right? So, give us some indication of how you’re feeling in the audience as to what your thoughts are. Are you one in the more inflationary sustained camp or two in the transitory and some sort of return to normalcy camp, and let us know how you’re feeling as we go through this. Inflation Volatility Rodrigo:  00:25:20  Yeah, and I think while we wait for that, it’s important to visualize what inflation volatility looks like, right? This is a paper, a series of papers that Man has put up, but this particular paper goes back to 1926. And it helps us visualize what CPI volatility has looked like for over a century. And what’s obvious here is how lucky we’ve been in the last 20 years to be in a period of such benign inflation that tends to be good for a number of things, right. It tends to be good for planning, it tends to be good for business building, and equity markets tend to thrive in that type of environment. When you have a bit more uncertainty -- and by the way, you can have a more and more narrow market that way. When you have a bit more uncertainty, there’s going to be more dislocations across the landscape of investments.

investments. But I thought it was useful to share this chart for everybody to see. Mike:  00: 26:19  And just to highlight it a little bit more, from 1990 to today, we’ve experienced inflation volatility of like around 1.3%. If you go back prior to 1990 into the late 1800s, so the previous sort of 100 years, you had inflation volatility that ran around 4.8%. Remember, this is inflation volatility. As Adam laid out, this swing from, oh, it’s disinflationary, it’s inflationary. These things were happening much more regularly, and had significant impacts on asset prices, where from 1990 we’ve had a fairly stable state of disinflation, which leads to certain asset classes, like stocks, for example, or real estate, really having some pretty pronounced returns and at low volatilities. And so as we potentially move into a regime that has more inflation, and I think we can all sort of concede that, well, certainly inflation volatility, whether this is transitory or not, the volatility of inflation has increased.  And thus, that is an era that’s new. And that’s a key concept here that I think is maybe not as understood as it could be because it’s new. It hasn’t happened in 30 years. And so we have a whole suite of investors, portfolio managers, allocators, who have had an experience in their career, careers lasting 20-30 years, that is purely one environment. And so it takes some time for that Overton window to pass through acceptance and sort of accepting a new reality, potentially, if that’s the case. So, just to give some more highlights on how that chart was sort of representing the information. Rodrigo:  00:28:07  So, what was the poll question there? So, we can just -- We got two thirds that has said one and ...

So, that’s great. I think that ... Rodrigo: 00:28:25  It’s all about -- the other thing is always, what do you mean by that, Mike? Like, I think it’s persistent. And for me, persistence means 12 months out, right. Are we thinking five years out, are we thinking... maybe the people that think it’s transitory, it is 12 months to 18 months. That’s a lot of time for -- that we can have runaway inflation, for and a lot of opportunities to make money. Mike:  00: 28:49  Well, like you said, is it the 40s where we’ve got this burst, and we’re going to now have a new equilibrium, but that’s it’s going to settle down, or is it this persistent sort of 70s scenario where yeah, here’s this type of inflation. Oh, and then here’s another type, and oh, here’s some more inflation for you. And oh, by the way, the central banks are going to get involved and they’re going to constrain liquidity in order to fight the inflation. Oh, again, this comes back to inflation volatility versus just inflation. And that’s, I think, it’s hard to argue that inflation volatility is not upon us. That I think, we can categorically say, the evidence points to yes, that’s here.  And maybe it settles down, maybe it’s the 40s and we get another five or 10 years where it attenuates, I don’t know. But you want to think about how to prepare portfolios for that and how those dynamics like growth and inflation, which we talk about a lot, we have our market target, we talked about those asset classes that perform well. Maybe it’s time to pop that chart up, Rod, and observe that you know, okay, so we’ve got to now take real steps in portfolios to prepare for a slightly different regime than we’ve had previously, and maybe it’s significantly different.

and Inflation Dynamics Where is the Puck Going to Be? Rodrigo:  00:30:12  Yeah. So, I mean, those who have been following us have probably seen this before. But this is just again, like stepping back. And from a fundamental framework perspective, understanding what moves the markets are really largely two dynamics, right. You got your growth dynamics and your inflation dynamics. And different asset classes are going to do differently whether we’re in a period of accelerating growth versus decelerating growth or accelerating inflation or decelerate inflation. And when you look at the vast majority of portfolios today, we see almost everybody really hovering in that bottom two quadrants, mostly in the bottom right quadrant, which is the requirement to thrive in that environment is benign inflation and persistent growth shocks.  And what does well in that environment is developed equities and developed bonds, right. And so that’s where we are today. That’s where we’ve been for the last 10 years. And the question is, if we are in an inflationary regime, I don’t think we even have to question that. We have seen inflation. And what we’ve seen perform really well has been what is expected in this framework, which is, in a rising inflation, environment, commodities, gold, TIPS are going to be a decent offset. Adam:  00:31:26  Emerging equities are interesting too. I mean, emerging equities as of yesterday, I think it was yesterday, they were up on the year, right, while developed markets are down sort of five to 10% or more. Mike:  00:31:40  Yeah. And this is one of those interesting things from a decade long experience. If we went back to 2000, US equities had done so well. And then from 2000 to 2010, 11, 12, 14, US equities have really struggled. But what did well? What did well?

those types of countries did well, international real estate did well. And so we’re in a situation where if you look at the last decade of returns and valuations on, let’s say US equities that represent that disinflationary growth quadrant, they’ve pulled a lot of those future returns into current valuations.  Contrast that with emerging markets over the last 10 years. Much better valuations, price action has not been great over the last decade. And so they haven’t pulled those future returns into today. So, if we’re thinking about how is this going to be over the next 10 years, as you mentioned, Rod like, where’s the puck going to be? You know, you have to make those considerations when you’re making your allocations. Rodrigo:  00:32:53  Yeah. And I think let’s take a look at the empirical data. So, we just said, theoretically, these asset classes should do well in an inflationary regime. Let’s kind of go through some of Man’s conclusions from that same paper, and just take a look which asset classes do well, which asset classes struggle? If I can find it here, yeah, let me share the screen. Okay. So, again, this is going back to 1926. And the two columns to look at here is the periods of inflation on the right hand side here. So, when they looked at the 1926 to now period, they found that 19% of the time we experience, we’ve been in an inflationary regime, and the other 81% of the time, it’s other, right.  And as expected from that framework, you’re seeing the best performing asset class is energies, right. And I think a lot of that has to do with looking at the 70s that was a big player in the energy space. Is that going to be the case in the future? We don’t know. I think we talked a little bit about this.

We’ll talk a little bit about the other categories here, which is trend, all asset trend, commodity trend, those tend to do really, really good job during inflationary periods.  And then the big losers are again, what we expect, right consumer durables, long equities is going to struggle, long duration fixed income, the 30-year Treasury had in that inflationary regime and annualized rate of return of negative 8%. You know, high yield fixed income, negative seven, the 10-year treasury, negative five. What else are we looking at? Adam:  00:34:54  Interesting, residential real estate. I think a lot of people have a perception that owning a home is good protection against inflation. And, in fact, if you look back historically, all the way to 1877, I think this goes, the real estate, residential real estate has delivered a return of negative 2%, annualized during inflationary periods. And I would argue that given the current structure of residential real estate, where loan-to-values are much, much higher in the current environment than they were in other inflationary periods, and we’re starting from a much lower initial rate, I would argue that the real estate market, residential real estate is as vulnerable as it’s ever been right now to rising rates. And I think a lot of Americans perceive that because you’re able to get a 30-year mortgage that that offers protection, and to some extent it does.  But what it means is that the ability to get credit to buy your home, for someone else to buy your home, it gets more and more difficult, right? So, for example, if I go back to 2019, the average rate on -- so, the average monthly payment on a new mortgage in the US was about $1,700. The average payment at the end of 2021 is about $2,200. And that’s a combination of larger mortgages on average, and higher rates on those mortgages, right. So, what it’s going to have an impact on primarily is labor mobility and new household formation.

I suppose some of the inflation hedge on the residential real estate side comes from the fact if you’ve owned your home and you’ve paid it off, or you have this locked in payment, then your cost of living has a slightly reduced exposure, potentially than if you’re a renter.

but it’s kind of  Because I think that’s informative to sort of... Rodrigo: 00:38:42  Yeah, so I think it’s a similar story here. Let me just... Mike:  00:38:49  Yeah, that’s the one.  Blind Spots and 60/40 Rodrigo:  00:38:50  Again, what we’re seeing here is that you have in the Y axis, near the top, you’re seeing what is correlated to persistent positive growth shocks. And near the bottom of the Y axis is persistent negative growth shocks. And the X axis to the left, it’s persistent negative inflation shocks or deflation or disinflation. And then to the right is persistent positive growth, inflation shocks. And when you examine where everybody largely is at, we just talked about real estate, we’ve talked about 60/40. You know, we could add private equity in here. We could add private credit like they’re all going to live in that top left, they’re going to be highly correlated to a disinflationary growth environment, right.  And so 60/40 is also way up there with equities because it’s 60/40. Even though you only have 60% of equities, the risk contribution from equities is 90%. So, whatever equities do your 60/40 is going to follow. So, the treasuries don’t provide much protection in terms of bear markets. So, the big blind spots clearly right now, if we’re going to, when you see a period of inflation volatility, you see a lot of dislocations, right. So, first of all, one of them is inflation and therefore a possible solution might be commodities. You see here that commodities are the only thing on the top right quadrant that can protect or offset some of the losses here from 60/40.  But also this type of inflation volatility leads to dislocations that oftentimes lead to bear markets that have negative growth shock consequences. And a 60/40, as we know, tends to have these very prolonged bear markets, because again, they’re dominated by that equity component.

they’re dominated by that equity component. And so there’s major blind spots in traditional portfolios right now, both from the inflation side, and the persistent bear market, not these, like liquidity shocks that we’ve experienced in the last 10 years, but rather, an actual changing of the guard from a bear market perspective. So, that’s, I think it’s an informative graph as well. Mike:  00:40:51  Yeah, it really highlights where we’ve been over the last 10 years. And so you’ve had a market cap adjustment, because those assets that are in the top left quadrant have done so well. And so people have probably allocated a little bit more there. And the allocations that they had 10 years ago have grown significantly in comparison to the other opportunities to invest. So, unless you’ve been rebalancing judiciously and continuing to allocate to these other quadrant assets, which would have been a drag for the last 10 years, you would have faced significant pushback from the asset owner potentially, because they’re not keeping up with everybody else who’s just doing something that’s more simple, easier to understand.  A nd this comes back to well, are we managing assets over one decade? Are we managing them over decades? How are we thinking about that? Are we making a prediction with the allocation to the top left quadrant, versus preparation? So, how might we think about being prepared for all the manifestations and then thinking about how we might impart some prediction or tilts to the portfolio? So, it seems to be a pretty opportune setup for the last decade’s darling to become the next decade’s dog, potentially.  End miniriff here Darlings to Dogs Adam:  00:42:17  I think that’s a really, really key point, right? Because I think the best example of that is the weightings in the S&P 500 where, obviously, it’s been an unbelievable decade for big cap tech.

in the S&P, larger as a proportion of total market cap than in any other time, other than the last couple of years in the 1990s tech bubble. And so you’ve got some companies and some sectors in the S&P that are designed to do well in inflationary periods. And if you go back and examine the returns to sectors over the past century, conditioned on inflationary environments, there’s only a few sectors that actually do okay. And even the best ones don’t really do that well.  So, energy historically has done the best with about a one or 2% annualized return real during inflationary episodes. Mining, gold companies, they’re sort of flat to slightly down to slightly up. Healthcare, flat, they’re slightly down to slightly up. So, sadly, the sectors that should do well, in an inflationary regime represent a minuscule portion of the total S&P right now. And the sectors that are most vulnerable to an inflationary regime currently represent by far the largest allocation in the S&P. So, this, I think, is a bad situation, especially for developed market equities and US cap-weighted equities in particular. Mike:  00:44:11  Yeah, and we’ve seen that transition previously. I mean, we’ve lived through the tech boom, where we saw tech become a very large part of the S&P. How big was Exxon in that? And then fast forward to 2008, where Exxon becomes the largest company in the S&P. Fast forward 10 years from that and again, you see that energy weighted, those large companies have become much smaller. And then so if you’re going to accept market cap weighting, then that’s your allocation. And until it changes, you’ll be behind the curve, I suppose. If you have a regime change, you’re going to have much smaller allocations to things that do well, and you’re going to have much larger allocations to things that do poorly in an environment which has

into the future for 20 or 30 years, those are going to suffer. And you’ll end up with those sectors that do well, but you’re just going to have a very small allocation until they grow into the new cash flows as the markets readjust themselves. Rodr igo:  00:45:24  Yeah. And this is where the passive market cap weighted portfolio, cheap portfolio that everybody’s bought into, will suffer and where I think active management may have opportunities at every level, right. Like, from stock selection to bond selection to active long-short manager selection. And in AQR’s paper, what I’m showing here is kind of their view of what -- if we are in an inflationary volatility regime what to do. And again, from that quadrant chart, it’s not surprising that you want to diversify internationally. Because generally speaking, where there’s inflation, there’s emerging markets that are commodity driven, that are benefiting from the rising commodity prices. You might see other global opportunities by the fact that the dollar tends to suffer and it’s easier for international markets to compete.  W ithin equities again, Adam talked about it like you’re likely if you take preventive steps to skew towards gold healthcare and energies, shorten duration for your fixed income, reduced credit risk, you can go to floating rate issuances. And then the alternative strategies, this is a big one. Nobody wants to do this right now, but it’s reduce your private equity allocations. I think they’re the most susceptible. Buy some commodities, and I think we’re going to make a case also for long-short multi-asset, right. This is this opportunity, I think this is where active management starts to shine again. End miniriff here Mike:  00:46:57  Yeah, well, why don’t you talk a little bit about dispersion, Rodrigo, as well? Because I think that you’re on a roll here, keep going. Dispersion Choices Matter Rodrigo:  00:47:05  Well, I think that we tend to be talking about inflation exclusively.

But the reality is that dispersion, of the dispersion of volatility means dispersion across all asset classes, right. There are downstream effects to having volatility go through the roof. I just mentioned a few. You have emerging markets that are going to benefit in a way that they have in the last decade, right? It’s been one place, benign inflation and persistent growth shocks, being able to see the future ahead of you. You’re going to pay money to the highest growth stocks, it’s cheap for you to borrow money in order to have that happen. When rates start going up, uncertainty gets higher, dispersion starts to happen. There’s going to be big losers, big winners, global diversification starts to help. Currencies start to go in a different way. It used to be US dollar and everything else.  Now we’re starting to see much more diversification between the pairs. And so it’s the idea that multi-assets tend to, and even risk parity, anything that’s just not S&P 500, or NASDAQ did so much better than S&P and NASDAQ in the 2000s, was due to the amount of opportunity sets they were. And so all of a sudden, you go from having a toolset that is, I have to buy the FANGs to an opportunity set that is much broader from within equity markets in value versus growth, energy markets. Like, these are really going to be dispersion opportunities that might save you and might give you not just an opportunity to minimize the loss of your purchasing power, but maybe even thrive during that decade, right, but it needs to be a massive shift in mindset.  And then you have to realize now that your tool set got huge. And you haven’t used, these are rusty -- you have to relearn how to use them and to remind yourself why you hated them and discarded them. So, you probably have to go buy a few new tools again, right. Then you have to change your IPS in order to be able to add assets.

So, there’s going to have to be a major overhaul to be able to access that toolset. But it’s going to ... Mike:  00:49:33  The dispersion creates the opportunity, right? We’ve had one thing do really well, and everything else sucks. Okay, well, that’s kind of meh. But now you’ve got well, there’s going to be a myriad of things that are doing well at different times. And the thing that has been so reliable and so consistent may not be that reliable and consistent, right. So, if you have a suite of 20 asset classes that you can invest in and they’re all going to be up 15% and they’re correlated, well, there’s no opportunity really for any kind of outperformance other than levering that. Whereas if you have those same 15 or 20 asset classes that have significant dispersion in their returns, now, you’ve got some opportunity for the rebalancing tailwind, you’ve got some opportunity to position yourselves in the different asset classes. As you said, it’s the return of active management. Rodrigo:  00:50:30  Yeah. And let’s just take one step back here, because I think this is a conversation about inflation. And when I speak with allocators, they are all contemplating what solutions. There are a lot of them, the first thing they’re doing is starting to lean towards more commodity based equities, which is interesting and useful. But a lot of them are thinking about these passive commodities, right? Like, let’s just do that. And I think I’m going to kind of -- we talked about inflation volatility, but let’s talk about the tool of commodities, right, this idea that, look, we’re going to have a decade of inflation.  And when people, you said it earlier, Mike, everybody thinks about the 70s as the decade of inflation. But it wasn’t a decade of inflation.

it wasn’t a decade of inflation. It was a decade of inflation volatility. What I’m showing on the screen now is in yellow, you have the commodities making 650% from point to point. Time capsule, you put it in your portfolio, wake up, 10 years later, you’ve killed it. And you’ve more than offset the losses in real terms that you’ve experienced from your equities and your bonds, which are the bottom two lines. But man that you have to hold on for a huge ride, right. You’re certainly solving the problem of the decade, but in between, the difficulty with using pure commodities as your tool to fight against inflation is whether you’ll be able to stick to it long enough to garner the fruits of your labor.  A nd so this is the 1970s. Again, the last commodity boom cycle was a similar thing. From 2000 to the peak of the commodity cycle, which was February 2011, you had massive volatility. Two major bear markets, one, 31% drawdown, another 60% drawdown. The drawdown in the 70s, I didn’t mention, was 37% and it took three years. Right. So, the issue, like how should we be thinking about this problem of inflation volatility? Should it be blunt instrument commodities? Or do we go back to this dispersion of opportunities and recognize that it’s more than just inflation, it’s more than just commodities, it’s opening up the whole tool set and how that can benefit you, not just from an inflation perspective, but from possibly even protecting you and thriving during bear markets. Right? End miniriff here Constructing Portfolios Mike:  00:52:53  It’s a function of the portfolio construction now, right? So, you’ve got this asset class, you say oh, well, I’ll just do commodities.

punch in the gut. Adam: 00:53:14  And it presupposes that you know that going into an inflationary environment in the first place, right?  Rodrigo:  00:53:20  That’s the next point that I wanted to make. Because first of all, I also pointed out that, do you guys remember late 2007, all the major institutions, were buying up that Deutsche Bank Commodity Index as a passive allocation to commodities? Of course, again, wrong place at the wrong time, right before that 60% correction. A bunch of them got shaken out, and they missed the opportunity from the bottom, I think commodities bottomed in December 2008, and then went for a massive run again until February 2011. Right? So, it’s really tough to stick to, right? And that is the best outcome, by the way. In the last two decades, isn’t -- during an inflationary or commodity boom cycle, that’s your best outcome?  T he reality is, like you said, you have to time it right, right? Because the Man paper goes on to show us that inflation has only happened 19% of the time, in the last 100 years. The other 81% of the time, most commodity buckets have a negative carry. And if you include just all of them as a bucket, you have a positive carry of 1%, right. So, are you going to use this as a strategic tool forever? No. I mean, if this -- because this is why nobody has them because they’ve experienced the 81%. And so now it’s up to the allocator to be a market timer. And that’s just a tough thing, right. So, I don’t think, I think my conclusion is that commodities on their own from an asset allocation perspective, where you are having to show that line item, may not be an ideal solution. Mike:  00: 54:57  Right. And I would add that in the two charts you showed in those inflationary regimes, the S&P does not do very well. And so yes, okay, there’s solutions.

And so yes, okay, there’s solutions. And why do we need the solutions? Well, 2000-2009, the return is very, very de minimis. And in the 70s, on a real basis, it’s a negative. Adam: 00:55:23  The real return to US equities during the 19% of the time, you’re in an inflation regime, the real return compounds at negative 7%. Mike:  00:55:32  That’s right. And so that’s what’s so important about inflation and inflation volatility, and its impact on asset class prices, right. This is why this is so pertinent and relevant for those who are allocating assets over multi- decade periods. Because it’s not a if, it’s when, so it happens, historically speaking, 19, let’s call it 20% of the time, so a fifth of the time, this happens. And if you are an allocator who allocates long term assets over multi- decades, you are assured that you are going to be in a period that has these inflationary dynamics. And thus, if you’re not allocating to assets that can help provide those real returns for those asset users, then you have to cut programs, cut spending, if you’re an individual. And so there are very real implications for the end asset user that are unpleasant if one just says I’m going to ignore this. End miniriff here Expanding the Toolbox Rodrigo:  00:56:39  Right. But we have to make it more palatable. I think again, going back to the -- you’ve used a hammer, and you’ve used a saw, and now we have this massive toolbox and you don’t know what to do. So, now we need to introduce something that’s more palatable. We’re asking people to buy gold or buy commodities, and we’re showing how difficult that would be right, behaviorally.

during the 19% of the time we’re in inflationary regimes, but also something that has a positive carry and possibly pretty decent results the other times, right.  A nd so, not surprisingly, this is a Man report. They did a trend, a simple trend on bonds, FX, equity commodities, right. Again, this is not trend, commodities, right. This is all of them. And the point here being it’s because dispersions of asset class returns both on shorts and longs become much more abundant across the board. So, bonds trend was a massive inflation hedge, right. Commodity trend obviously got an inflation trend. Equity and FX did okay, right. So, all of a sudden, you just have opportunities everywhere to offset those negative returns you’re getting in real terms from equities, and fixed income. And then the other 81% of the time, the average of this all asset trend, is an annualized 15% rate of returns.  Now, the problem with the other 81% of the time is that there are many periods like the last decade where you have a single market dominating all of the returns, and you’re going to drastically underperform that and it’s going to be tough. But in spite of all the hate trend has gotten in the last decade, it’s still offered positive carry. It’s not like commodities, which we’ll show in a second, which had a pretty bad outcome. Mike:  00:58:33  Yeah. So, let’s expand the toolbox? Yeah, what are we going to do? So, go ahead. Rodrigo: 00:58:40  So, here, this is just again to finish off the thought here, AQR did, it’s kind of separated in three, we talked a little bit about what happens during inflationary shocks. There were a few comments by Brian in the comment section about persistent inflation, right, when you get to 4%, you stay that way.

inflation, stable inflation. And then the light blue bars are when you have negative inflation shocks, right and commodities are linear, right? They do really, really well during periods of inflationary, positive inflationary shocks. They don’t do well, they don’t have a lot of positive carry during stable inflation and they really hurt you when it’s deflation, right? And the opposite of that is US Treasuries, right?  B ut then when you look at trend, you have this smile with a big thick center as well, where you have the opportunity to provide true positive carry even when inflation is persistent, right. Again, talking about the dispersion of opportunities. And the other one here is macro, right? So, trend and macro seem to have this smile across these three different regimes.  Adam:  00:59:55  The blue bars there are periods when your traditional portfolios are kicking ass, right? Like the light blue bar, when inflation is benign, there’s no material inflation shocks in either direction, your classic cap weighted 60/40 style portfolio is rocking, right. And you know, trend is doing something that’s kicking along. But the other traditional segment of the portfolio is going to completely dominate. What’s so great about trend and macro momentum or macro is that when those traditional markets that you love to hold are suffering, that’s when trend and macro have their best years. And so they really are a terrific complement. Rodrigo: 01:00:48  Yeah. And so what did that -- now we’re going to go back to those two decades because I think it’s important to kind of show what that looks like. And so this, I start here with the 2000 to 2011 period, and I’m going to add some multi- asset, right, some active multi-asset. The yellow line continues to be commodities with that 31% loss and that 60% loss. Of course, the strategy near and dear to our hearts is risk parity.

Risk Parity Index here. What’s fascinating about this index is that it did just as well as commodities, from point to point almost like to the T, but without the volatility, right. A little bit of volatility there in 08, but largely speaking, it cruised through that inflationary period.  But importantly, the Goldman Sachs Macro Risk Premia Index, here we’ve scaled it to 10% and deducted a 3% performance fee, or fee on it. It actually absolutely crushes it, because again, that dispersion of opportunity, the ability to make money in trend and value and carry when there’s dispersion is just astounding, right? And if we take this to the 70s, it’s the exact same story, right? Like, risk parity does just as well, as – risk parity 10% volatility does just as well as commodities do without the volatility, without a 37% drawdown.  And then in this case, I’m using AQR’s Future Diversified Trend Index again, because of that diversification and the opportunity sets that are abundant, you do really, really well, right. So, if you’re thinking about an inflation hedge, I dare say this might be a good place to start. The real question is, why isn’t everybody buying into this? Why haven’t we discovered this and are doubling down and selling our private equity and buying as much as we can of this? And of course, it comes down to the fact that the last 10 years.  So, this is a chart showing the same asset classes from 2011, the peak of the commodity crisis to roughly now. Well it did okay. Again, positive carry for both strategies, but the S&P has absolutely dominated returns. Why not commodities? Well, you can see why not commodities, right?

drawdown and a bunch of other double digit draw downs in between. The other thing to point out is, this is indicative of all asset classes. But in the yellow line here, you’ll see that there’s not a lot of dispersion. It just kind of flat lined sideways for most of the last 10 years. And when you have little opportunity, when you have out of your 70 futures contracts that you can invest in one or two asset classes to truly lean on for returns, you’re just not going to -- it’s not going to be your decade.  And so I read a tweet yesterday or the day before about how KKR has basically increased their allocations by over 50% in a single year. And they’re a billion dollar organization, right?

But if we’re right and there’s inflation volatility, it might be a massive opportunity that you’re missing out on, right.

like you may be seeing that today in the dominant equity index, having large and broad adoption and private equity and those types of things. And you look back at the last 10 years, you say, well, why would I own any of those other things, they’ve done nothing but reduce my potential returns.  I mean, this is performance chasing at its best, it’s that behavioral bias; how can I do things that haven’t done well? How am I going to sell that to a Board? How am I going to put it in portfolios? How do you as an advisor, you go in, someone comes into your office, and you say, okay, you need 30% exposure to these alternative asset classes. And they say, well, show me how that’s done over the last 10 years, and you show them equity line that is substantially below the simple strategy of buy and hold. And so that’s really, really a difficult conversation to have at all levels of strata, whether it’s institutional, retail, this is a really tough conversation to have. And you’ve seen that consistent narrowing of opportunities in the IPSs broadly across all of those, that continuum of asset owners. And so it happens over and over again. Rodrigo: 01:06:47  Yeah. And we haven’t seen inflation, but we also haven’t seen prolonged bear markets, right. So, I think that the interesting part of this is that I just went through those charts, right, and I’m going to go through them again, but just highlight. You know, as you mentioned earlier, Mike, when there’s this type of inflation volatility, there are a lot of bear markets. And so how do these multi asset strategies do in bear markets? Well, they do really well. Right? 82% positive returns during the credit crisis bear market, and then the Goldman Sachs index. 28% positive returns during the 08 crisis. And then ... Mike:  01: 07:18  I think that’s the -- you mentioned, it’s a tech crisis that you mentioned just for those listening to those.

just for those listening to those. Yeah, 82% versus 47% down in the tech crisis, and then 53% decline in the great financial crisis versus 28% for the global macro. Sorry, go ahead, just for those listening. Rodrigo: 01:07:32  Yeah. And those companies during that mid-70s bear market, that was a 42% correction in the S&P, and the -- that’s nominal. And then you have the AQR Index up 138%, right. So, we just haven’t experienced these like good old fashioned bear markets. And a lot of this, this space has been vilified because they haven’t done fantastically well and really abrupt liquidity shocks. But that’s not what they’re designed for. Right? If we go back to these traditional ones, I think they will perform really, really well. And now you got to -- so, one of the best things about all this is just going back to that target chart is you can you may be able to kill two birds with one stone. Right? We started this conversation with inflation protection and what could offset it. We showed that possibly the best option is multi-asset long/short.  And then by happenstance, we stumbled upon the fact that, oh, they also solved the bear market issue. So, I think we got to stop thinking about, particularly the multi-asset space as a just an alt that you want to have a nice to have to have a little bit of extra juice, and more about a pillar of portfolio construction, not a 5% allocation, but kind of think about it from a risk parity lens and say, okay, you got your equities and you got your bonds, everybody knows those. I got a third thing that the purist risk parity guys tell me I should have, commodity purely, but I know that’s not going to work. This may replace commodities and actually do a better job. Right?

macro trading are useful and empirically more useful than just commodity trend and commodity macro trading. And it’s because sometimes the best place to bet on inflation is by shorting bonds. Sometimes the best way to bet on a negative growth shock is to short equities. And so just the commodity trend idea is, it seems intuitive, like you kind of want to get long commodities and you like the trend overlay. But you’re missing the opportunity from shorting some of the markets that are functionally designed to not do well in inflationary shocks, like bonds, for example. And that’s why the multi-asset trend that includes allocations to trend equities and trend FX and trend rates does substantially better than just the trend commodities in virtually every period. Mike:  01:10:26  And there’s a reason why you get to kill two birds with one stone, as Rodrigo says, is that well, what causes major prolonged bear markets? Well, a lot of the time, it’s substantial and persistent inflation shocks.  Adam:  01:10:44  So, central banks need to step in and raise rates to the point to slow demand in order to contain inflation. Exactly. Yeah. Mike:  01: 10:52  Yeah. And so there’s a structural reason why you have this opportunity to hedge a portfolio against these two very critical risk factors with this approach. Because that’s driven by these inflation volatility, inflation and its volatility and those shocks that come with it. So, you’ve got some offset and that helps attenuate those large drawn out bear markets. Rodrigo: 01:11:20  And Adam, just to put some numbers to the comment that you made about why not just trend commodities versus trend all assets? In the Man paper, you can see here that trend all assets during an inflationary regime ...  Mike:  01: 11:32  You’re not sharing your screen, Rod, if you’re ...

 01:11:36  Oh, I’m sorry.  Rodrigo:  01:11:36  Yeah. So, trend all assets -- Let’s talk about trend commodities annualized at 20% during the 19% of the time, that was inflation, so 20%, your inflationary periods and 8% in other, right, positive return? So, positive carry in other, 20% in inflation. The all asset did 25% annualized and 15% in other, right. So, this is an interesting thing. Again, the intuition is that you want to do commodities. And the intuition is, well, why don’t we do commodity trends? And then you’ve come to the conclusion that it’s not just about inflation. It’s about all of the dynamics, the knock on effects around inflation volatility. Adam: 01:12:13  So, let’s -- Sorry, Mike, you finish up. Mike:  01:12:15  This last point, we hear this over and over again, as we’re interacting with allocators, investors, advisors, this whole idea, well, I’ll just buy some energy stocks, or I’ll do this little thing or I’ll allocate here and there. And it’s, well, it’s kind of a step in an okay direction. But if you can broaden your mind a little bit and open your mind and do the work in order to get comfortable with the strategies and understand how the allocation methodologies work, I think you can, you can get comfort and actually be excited about the opportunity to differentiate, given the potential for a slightly different regime, or a significantly different regime. End miniriff here Where the Rubber Hits the Road Solutions to the Problem Adam:  01:12:54  So, let’s talk about how the rubber hits the road here, like for investors that want to take this kind of step, what are some of the options, right? I mean, obviously, one option, which may be a good first step is to take what Rodrigo said, which is, kind of trim back your 60/40 portfolio to free up some capital, and then allocate to a few trend

capital, and then allocate to a few trend and macro trading funds, right? To get some juice there on the inflation side, right. So, that’s kind of a simple step that I think most advisors can take to some extent. And then we’ve obviously done a lot of talking recently, published papers, etc., indices about this return stacking concept where you actually don’t need to take away exposure from your core holdings. But rather, you can stack these trend and macro trading strategies directly on top of full exposure to 60/40. So, maybe, Rod, you’re sort of the progenitor here, why don’t you talk about... Rodrigo: 01:14:03  Yeah. And so this is, by the way, Milan, just added a comment here, like throw in some convexity and take advantage of that downside and maybe some upside from Newfound and Simplify has cool Structured Alpha Indices.... Yeah, of course, the Stacking Returns piece was written with Corey Hoffstein from Newfound. So, if you go to returnstacking.com, you’ll be able to download the paper but the long and short of that is that you -- again, talking about behavior, right? The reason everybody sold this out is because you’re dragging returns down in a decade where CTAs and global macro have done single digit.  Okay. So, what’s the solution to this? How can we give you what you need? How can you get that behavioral need for tracking the market that you care about and also get the sugar on top that protection on top, where you’re not going to give up on it in a decade where it does single digits? Well, today there are a number of products that have stacking embedded into their products, meaning you give them $100, you can get more than $100 of two different types of betas, bonds equities, so

on top of that a systematic global macro.  So, you add, Simplify has some basic beta with convexity, Hoffstein has and Newfound has 75%, active equity, 75% active bonds, so it goes on and on. And then you can put them together in a way where, in the case of the report, we did 60 equities, 40 bonds, and then 30, CTA and 30 global macro, and we just did this analysis, Corey and I, for the last decade. The difference between the 60/40 and the stacked return is positive, there’s a positive carry there, an annualized return about one, but it’s kind of small, right? What does that mean? Well, you got your diversification and you didn’t give up on it. But then if you examine that same portfolio from 2000 to 2011, the stacking is like 500 basis points, it’s a massive dispersion, right. So, it’s a way to think about capital efficiency using 40 Act funds that allow you to stick to it. And then maybe if we’re right about inflation volatility, you get a boost and a bonus. Mike:  01:16:37  Yeah, it’s addressing the behavioral vulnerability of tracking error. And at the moment, in today’s world, the tracking error’s with the 60/40 we ... that’s not always the case, as we’ve experienced through our careers, that it’s not always the US 60/40 that is the premium or paramount tracking error issue.  Adam: 01:16:58  Well, you couldn’t talk investors into buying the S&P in 2007, they wanted nothing to do with it. Right. Mike:  01:17:05  Yeah. And so again, it’s that, what is it that the end investor can actually tolerate is a very important part of the calculus that goes into what you can propose for them. And my estimation is that as we move through the next decade, we may see an attenuation of that peak tracking error being to the 60/40.

60/40. Maybe not, maybe not, but that would be you know, my thinking is, I would propose that that’s a probable event. But who knows, what do I know? Sorry, go ahead.  Rodrigo: 01:17:39  I just wanted to -- Corey, and I put these together today, actually. So, here you can see it, this is the last decade where the blue line is a 60/40 portfolio and the black line is the  Stacked Return Index, right? Some benefits, some excess return, not amazing. But better than the yellow line, which is the non-levered version, right, where you’re just making room in the last decade to add those diversifiers.  Mike:  01:18:07  But you’ve actually got to take capital allocation away from your 60/40 in order to add it over here. Rather, let’s stack it on top. Yeah. Rodrigo:  01:18:17  And by the way, I’m not opposed to that. I think it’s awesome and you should do that, if that’s the only thing you can do and leverage is something that you can’t do. It’s just you then just have to think about it in a different way. But here’s the contrast, right, to the previous decade, 2000s. Even the non-levered index did significantly better and acted as that diversifier we’ve been saying and acted as a protection against bear markets. But certainly the stacked version of it did even better. So, anyway, food for thought in terms of like rubber hitting the road that is how they think about this. And that might be a behavioral way of getting better at it for yourself, your clients, your institution, whatever the case may be.

when you have these discussions, the first thing that comes to mind is, wait, hold on a second. Are you telling me, like I was thinking about adding a 5% position to this as my diversified alternative sleeves, right. I have this, I have private credit, I have my long-short manager, I have my market neutral manager. What should I do with those? And I’m not opposed to having any one of those as an alpha overlay, especially if you can stack them. Okay. Because you can... the thing about market neutral, for example, is that it’s not designed to be a diversifier in periods of inflation or negative growth shocks, right? It’s designed to give you two different kinds of basis points a year. So, it’s kind of like the cherry on top, right, of your account, for example.  I see it as that where inflation is 10%, you’re going to get two to 300 basis points. So, negative 700 basis points of real return. You get deflation 400%, you’re going to get 200 basis points, that’s not going to change. The difference between those types of alts, and CTAs and global macro is that you would expect them to do really outsized double digit returns in both those prolonged periods of inflation, and prolonged periods of bear markets, if history and the analysis that we’ve done is any indication. And so the last thing I’ll say about alternatives that I try to point out, and I’ll show here is that the correlations of these alternatives -- one of the biggest complaints about hedge funds is that they’re not really hedgey, right? Like, they’re supposed to be different, but they’re quite similar.  And I got to say that there is something to that. And just share my screen here quickly. There is something to that when we look at this slide, which I just grabbed the hedge fund indices in the HFRI database. We’re looking at activist hedge, equity hedge, market directional, event driven, special sit, value arbitrage, absolute return, convertible merger and relative value, market neutral.

then the first line is the S&P, their correlation to the S&P. So, we’ve ordered them, Corey and I, from most correlated to least correlated. And we do get again to the point where the only one that I see as lowly correlated enough to warrant it being called a hedge fund is the Market Neutral Index. But again, that’s not designed to be a pillar of portfolio construction.  When we move into the SocGen CTA and Macro Risk Premia, they’re non-correlated to equities, and non- correlated to fixed income, right, which I think we’ve talked about throughout this podcast. The other two that are worth mentioning in terms of non-correlation is the Currency Index, though, currency is already embedded in both the CTA and the global risk premia. And then the Short Bias Index that has the lowest correlation, but sadly, it also has a persistent negative carry to it, right?  So, when you are considering your alts sleeve, and you have a limit as to how much you can do, and you’re worried about inflation and bear markets, I got to say, like, you got to think about, believe that the private equities and all the things that are just other ways of equity, and really beefing up your inflation protection and bear market protection. I mean, we got to think about it this way. Mike:  01:22:41  It’s a function of the real estate, right, so you’ve got limited real estate. And what is the real estate -- yeah, portfolio real estate. And so what do you hope to achieve via the exposure to that portfolio real estate, and private equity is simply another asset class that does well in positive growth, benign inflation ... yeah, its equity. So, it’s not going to give you that shock absorption on the way down. So, if you only have five to 10%, again, this is one of those really interesting pieces of portfolio construction. You need it to be non-correlated, and you needed to deliver outsized returns during that period.

do something but they’re not going to give you the outsized return that you need to contribute to the portfolio to offset the other poor performing asset classes in said portfolio. And so real estate, as you think about the allocation mechanisms within your portfolio, have to be thought through on a case by case basis for the limits and restrictions that different asset owners have. And that’s actually where I think that it really becomes important to have someone with some expertise to help walk you through that, because it’s going to be a little bit uncomfortable to and as I think you advocate, Rod, it’s like you need 30% of an allocation.  Rodrigo:  01:24:13  At least. You know us, we think about it from a risk parity perspective. And so there’s more complexity there, right. If it were up to me, you’d have a massive bond position, a small equity position, and you know, the right level of volatility in my multi-asset, so that I can have balance between the three pillars, right, imagine three pistons in a motor all being able to contribute the same amount of power, right? So, there’s ways that you need to -- if you’re willing to have tracking error, you can think about it. But generally, like, from a practical perspective, most people are so married to their 60/40 that what I’m begging them to consider is just pro rata that down and add that third piston in your motor. You absolutely need it and are missing it and nothing else will do, right, in terms have the characteristics and qualities that these tend to have in the biggest blind spots in 60 and 40. Adam: 01:25:08  Yeah. I mean, they could, in theory, just take their 60/40 portfolio, replace it with an allocation to NTSX for two thirds of it. So, now you’re getting a full exposure to 60/40 and then take the rest of the capital and allocate it to trend funds too. Like there’s a few ways to spin this.

there’s a few ways to spin this. End miniriff here Rodrigo:  01:25:26  There’s a few ways to do it, right? The concept of return stacking can be wide-varying. We just ... The Return Stacking Index Mike:  01:25:34  That’s why it takes, I think, a thoughtful practitioner. Like you need -- this is something that you know, on the surface may seem simple, but it’s actually -- it requires some significant thought and you see that in the Return Stacking Index that that has been created. You know, there’s a list of publicly traded funds there and each of them offer different parts of this puzzle. And so when you X-ray through them, that’s how you get to this exposure that Rodrigo highlighted earlier having the 60/40 and 30% to global macro, etc., and getting this return stacked situation, you had to X-ray these types of funds and so there’s extra work there. As I mentioned earlier, this requires a deeper level of thought. It requires some actual understanding and learning because you need to be able to be comfortable with it when it’s uncomfortable, right. If you just do it, okay, that sounds good. I’ll do it. Well, when it gets hard you may abandon it. And when do you abandon it? You don’t abandon it when it’s working, you abandon it when it’s not working and thereby you accept the loss with, and call it the risk with no commensurate return. So, making sure you’re comfortable with these types of philosophy so that you can stick to it is incredibly important. Rodrigo:  01:26:58  Yeah. Please, please, please do not take this as investment advice. I mean, this requires lots of discussions with your advisor or whoever it is that you trust the most. Like, you need to think thoroughly about all of this and implementation before you do anything. So, we’re happy to help and you can always reach out to us. Corey is in the chat as well.

Anyway, I think we’ve covered all the places where there’s reports and links as we’ve talked about them, we’ll probably throw those in the show notes.

 00:01:00  Man, I've been waiting for this one ... Corey and Rodrigo on the hot seat, for weeks. Corey:  00:01:06  I'm going to be a really bad guest on the podcast and just take over from the start... Adam:  00:01:12  All right. So, what's new, dude? Every time you come on you takeover. It's almost like you're a podcast host yourself. The $10 Billion Masterclass The $10 Billion Limit Corey:  00:01:16  Why is your Masterclass only for institutions $10 billion and less? Adam:  00:01:21  ... Rodrigo:  00:01:22  Well, if you don't understand it, then we can't explain it to you, bud.  Corey: 00:01:25  Okay. Rodrigo:  00:01:26  Can you get off the channel now? Adam:  00:01:29  For reals, Rodrigo. Why? Come on. Rodrigo:  00:01:31  So the reason that we target that audience is because a lot of what we do is in the commodity complex, right? And so, there is a liquidity constraint with regard to what any institution can do in real size on commodities. There is CFTC limits for asset managers. I mean, AQR is bumped up on that already and can't offer a lot of commodity-based features that they can on the institutional side. So that's kind of the sweet spot. We're not going to get an allocation from 100 billion dollar or whatever pension plan, because we won't be able to implement it for them. So anybody, you know we prefer the $10 billion threshold, we'll manage your money at $10 billion. But beyond that, it would be difficult to implement. Adam:  00:02:21  You know, there's a broader answer here, right, which is that big institutions just don't have the liquidity, sorry, like the portfolio agility or the mandate flexibility to be able

portfolio agility or the mandate flexibility to be able to take advantage of active strategies, right? Like, when you get into the 10s of billions and hundreds of billions, you just can't run strategies on timeframes where the high Sharpe ratios live. So you've got to really just take advantage of long-term risk premia, right? So if you look at the Dutch pension plan, a lot of the major sovereign wealth funds, the major state pension plans, large corporate plans, like they just don't run active strategies the way that we think about active, right? They think private equity infrastructure, basically, long-term risk premia. Corey:  00:03:10  That reminds me of, and I think, I've told you guys this story, but a meeting I had once with Norges Bank, which is Norway's Sovereign Wealth Fund, which, by the way, when they set up the meeting, I didn't realize was Norway's Sovereign Wealth Fund. It was the week after I was supposed to get back from my honeymoon, and these people from Norges Bank emailed me and said, “Hey, we're going to be in town, we'd like to meet with you.” To which I was like, “Well, it seems like a Bank of America.” So I just said to them, I was like, “Look, I'm coming back from my honeymoon, I don't have any time to prepare.”  I sit in the meeting with them, they then proceed to tell me they're the Sovereign Wealth Fund of Norway. And I'm like, probably should have prepared for this meeting. Regardless, I was never getting an allocation. It was just sort of an educational introduction. They had read some of the papers I had written. But they were telling me at that point, they were starting a real estate investment. And to do it at a fund of their size, they had to hire 100 people so that they could then scour the entire globe for real estate opportunities, because for them to deploy that much capital, that's what it really took.

what it really took. Adam:  00:04:11  Yeah. Corey:  00:04:11  So to your point, there's just the size limits that are beyond which it's hard to do much other than just beta. Mike:  00: 04:17  I think it's interesting too, when I hear advisors, allocators, individual investors who are smaller, obviously, and eschew the potential advantages that they have in being smaller asset pools, to go pursue some super institutional approach where it's for $100 billion funds. Does it make sense to give up the potential portfolio agility you have in smaller pools, and then some mandates have more mandate flexibility too. Some don't depend on a board, right? So if you have to maneuver through a board, and then if your board has expectations around the return streams, let's say it's a pension, right. So the actuarial side of it is there's a capital stack here that I need to assign a long-term risk premium to, and I need to match that against the liabilities that I'm paying out. And so what is the risk premium of your active tactical strategy that I can put to my actuaries? And the answer is there really isn't one. And so, or it's hard ... Adam:  00:05:30  Well honest, quants will tell you that there's a wide range and actuaries are able to use the empirical history of equity indices and bond indices and claim that those are the expectations where they can't do that with active strategies. And so there's constraints, yeah, that make it very challenging. Mike:  00: 05:50  So before we get too much deeper into this, I want to do a couple of announcements, right? One is that four dudes on a Friday talking investment stuff, is not advice. This is entertainment, baby. So, enjoy the entertainment. And what was the other one?

this is meant to be interactive today. So we've got questions that we've collected, which are the top questions for the Return Stacking paper, and we'll go through those, but we'll also be looking for participation if we can -- Adam: 00:06:29  I want to also ask because Corey, you co-hosted for me for last week in a backwards baseball cap, and some kind of quasi-sweater and like, there was a look that you were going for. Corey:  00:06:49  I know. I got a lot of comments on that.  Adam:  00:06:51  And now you've got the, you know, your buttoned up, you've got the glasses on, your hair's done. Are you going for a different personality? Corey:  00:07:00  The hair is not done. You know, what's funny is Rod was on a call with me earlier today, where I had to send someone a headshot, and the woman goes, I don't know if you were on at this point, Rod. But she was like, “You don't look anything like the headshot you sent.” And I was like, “Well, this is what I call pandemic chic.” I'm wearing like a Tommy Bahama shirt, I've grown out a mustache, and I've just given up on my hair.  Rodrigo: 00:07:23  This is my favorite new movie before we go live with Corey. Moustache, you have a curling up the moustache. Corey:  00:07:31  Well, I have a problem which is one side naturally curls up. The other one naturally curls down. This is what happens when you have curly hair. Adam:  00:07:37  Oh, there's no way you can deal with that asymmetry, dude, that must drive you crazy.  Corey:  00:07:41  Yeah, the OCD really goes off.

thank you. Backgrounder Why Stacking Returns? Adam:  00:07:46  Yes. Yeah. Exactly. All right. So, we are here today to talk about the new Stacking Returns paper. Before we get going, let's talk about what motivated you guys to think about this theme, and why would we write this paper. For those listening, this is primarily the brainchild of Rodrigo and Corey. So Mike and I are going to kind of moderate a discussion and put Rodrigo and Corey on the spot for a change. So which one of you wants to go first? Why did you guys write this paper? What's it for? Who's it for? What problem are you solving? Rodrigo: 00:08:26  Yeah. Corey, why don't you start with kind of the evaluation, expensive markets and all that? Corey:  00:08:31  Yeah. We can start there. So I think just about every major investment firm out there has been forecasting low real returns for a traditional 60/40 portfolio for the better part of, at least half a decade, most major firms since 2015, under the expectation that there's going to be strong reversion in equity valuations, which are historically high right now. And that when you look at fixed income, the gravity is a little stronger, that your starting yield to worst is a pretty strong predictor of your forward nominal returns. So you subtract out inflation, even if you sort of discount inflation below what a lot of people think it'll be, you're still talking about real returns for a 60/40 portfolio that are depressed on a historical basis. You sort of contrast that to the experience everyone has had with the 60/40 over the last decade, particularly American investors who we deal with predominantly who have that home country bias and invest in the S&P. And it has been over the last decade, one of the highest realized risk adjusted returns for the 60/40 portfolio ever, going back at least 100 years.

Corey:  00:09:53  Yep. So you have this unbelievable total return, unbelievable risk adjusted return, and you contrast that with the expectation that going forward returns are going to be quite poor. And so we have this struggle, which is everyone is anchored to the wonderful performance of a 60/40. And it is becoming more and more difficult to have conversations with advisors and investors and move them off of that base, while recognizing that staying with that base is driving while looking in the rearview mirror. And so there have been a number of products that have come to market now that are enabling us to do new and interesting things with the portfolio. And I'll let Rodrigo go into that a little bit more.  But the question was, how can we sort of bridge the gap, which is, people aren't moving off the 60/40. But we need to find ways to introduce new sources of return and new sources of diversification, particularly potentially towards things like inflation, without making them very uncomfortable, the way that introducing liquid alternatives over the last decade did. And so that's where a lot of this return stacking idea came from. Last thing I'll say is I need to give credit where credit is due. Rodrigo came up with the phrase “return stacking”. I think it's brilliant and how easily it explains what we're trying to achieve, both on the pros and the potential risk side. So all credit to him for the paper title and the concept. Rodrigo:  00:11:19  Thanks, Corey. I think the one thing that really drove me to try to find a better solution is the fact that when you compare how people perceive the expensiveness of a bond versus equities, they can see a low yield in bonds. And what has happened is that its caused investors and advisors to move up the risk scale, right, move up to more equities or equities that are bond-like or bonds that are actually high yielding high-risk assets that ultimately, you can see a line item that you might say it's 40% bonds.

when you dig into it, it's really just a different way of getting exposure to equities.  And the portfolios have gotten highly procyclical, meaning that whatever offset you might have gotten in a bear market or a negative market shock from bonds, it's no longer going to be there, right? So you see more and more of these advisors, seeing the low yield in bonds, adding to equities to reach for yield, get a higher return without them realizing that it's really putting their clients futures at risk. So that was, to me, I saw that and said there's got to be something we can do to add diversification and improve that, help them keep their 40% bonds and stack different types of diversified returns on top. End Mini-riff here Solving For Problems Hedging That Inflation Risk Adam:  00:12:40  Is there any particular environment that 60/40 is specifically vulnerable to that we're trying to kind of solve for here? Corey:  00:12:51  Adam, I like, the volleyball, light, gentle language. Adam:  00:12:55  I'm not used to softballs, man. I'm trying to serve you guys up. Rodrigo: 00:12:59  You can also answer that one, Adam. What do you think?  Corey:  00:13:03  Yeah. I mean, you've done enough study on risk parity, you dive in. Adam: 00:13:09  Well, yeah, I mean, I think everyone knows that both stocks and bonds are not structurally set up to thrive in periods of higher than expected inflation or lower than expected growth, right. Equities, by their nature, are designed to do well, during periods of abundant liquidity, benign inflation and better than expected growth. Bonds are designed to do well during periods of below expected or low inflation and below expectations in terms of growth. So, you have this completely other side of the macroeconomic picture that we really haven't seen much of in the last 30 years, which is this period of high inflation, and where growth continues to

where growth continues to come in a little below expectations, which some people call stagflation, where both bonds and equities are kind of designed to suffer.  A nd because of the flight to passive, and how well 60/40 has done over the last 10, 20, 30 years, very few people have felt the need to diversify into investments that are designed to do well during stagflationary environments. And there's a reasonable probability, perhaps higher than we've seen in the last 20 or 30 years, that we may be entering into a stagflationary environment now, and at a period of extremely low expected bond returns, and probably extremely low equity returns. And so maybe now more than ever, for the generations that are currently investing, we should be thinking about how to hedge that inflation risk.  Corey:  00:14:58  And if I can do that, add one thing really quickly, Mike, before you dive in. I do want to say like, as much as I might discount that people are just anchored, or as much as I might sound like I'm just saying people are anchoring to the last 10 years, I do think there are some rational aspects of sticking with the 60/40, in some ways. For example, if we believe that returns going forward are going to be depressed, then two of the most important levers that you have to work with are fees and taxes. Right? So when we talk about introducing diversifying alternatives that are often a higher fee, and less tax efficient, people go, “Well, I don't really want to sell my productive core financial assets to move into that space.”  S imilarly, introducing something like commodities. Well, there isn't really a clear answer as to whether passive commodity exposure, which you can get very cheaply, will give you a risk premium. So if you already have a low expected return, and then you start selling those productive assets to buy something that might have zero risk premium, even if it's diversifying, now your expected return is that much lower.

I think that is a good answer. But I have heard some rational arguments as to why you might not necessarily make some of what seem like obvious asset allocation decisions. Adam:  00:16:18  Yep. No, that's totally fair. Rodrigo: 00:16:20  And that's ... Different Efficient Frontiers Mike:  00:16:20  I think that I think the other thing that you guys have covered, but maybe not explicitly as well, and I want to bring to the forefront here is the idea of diversification, and how the efficient frontier changes in the various different economic regimes. Maybe I can just show my screen here for a second, because I think this is -- we haven't looked at this graphic in a long time. Rodrigo:  00:16:46  Is it different efficient frontiers. Mike:  00:16:48  Yeah, over the decades, right. So if we -- how come it shows my screen here instead of --  okay. There we go. Rodrigo:  00:17:04  But yeah, I mean, just generally speaking...  Corey:  00:17:05  ... Mike:  00:17:07  Yeah, a challenge, real challenge. So you can see, in these efficient frontiers, you have the 60s, the 70s, the 80s, the 90s, the 2000s, and then the entire period. And the interesting thing is, in that period, where Adam highlights this idea of stagflation, which is the 70s, you can see that green line. The efficient frontier is, in fact, just simply a straight line. And it's a straight line because there is no benefit of diversity in stocks and bonds. And that's really the last decade where that happened. Another interesting one that maybe harkens back is the red, efficient frontier of the 2000s, where it's actually inverted.

right. And that was a function of excess value. We can drop that, I think, now and come back to do I ... Adam: 00:18:04  That’s just valuations, you mean coming off the 2000 top? Mike:  00:18:07  Yeah. And so when you think about what you outline, Adam, as being the potential for a little bit more inflationary pressures as we go forward over the next decade, and how that has implications for rates, and looking at high equity valuations, this is very much like the late 1960s, the nifty 50s. And you get into a period where you have negative real returns for both stocks and bonds, and they're correlated. Like, the big thing to me is, and they are correlated, like the 2000s. Well, yeah, okay, equities were pretty crummy. But stocks and bonds were not correlated. They were very uncorrelated. And thus, if you held a portfolio of both and rebalanced you actually fared okay. That's not what happens in the 70s. Rodrigo: 00:18:58  Yeah, yeah. And I think the issue is clear of having those two asset classes. We see the blind spots, but those who have seen the blind spots in the last 10 years and done something about it, have struggled, right, have, because of what Corey mentioned, right? What have you done? You grab the two best performing asset classes, reduce your allocation to them to make space for alternative strategies. Some of them may have been CTAs that have had, comparative to their previous 20 years where they were doing mid to high double digits. In the last decade, they've done low single digits, right. So if you're dragging down 30% of your portfolio to add to these CTAs, or managed futures managers that have exposure to commodities, because you see the writing on the wall, you've gotten fired over and over again, and that's one of the things that we address in the paper ...

 You're sure picking on managed futures. I mean, that I think you've got to expand that to basically every factor strategy, every other jurisdiction. You know, every other asset class has suffered relative to US equities and treasuries and credit. End Mini-riff here Chasing the Returns Corey:  00:20:15  So can I toss out a tangential question because this was something I was pondering as I wrote my quarterly commentary, which was, you've had this large expectation for the last half decade, even going back to 2013, that markets are overvalued, you should see depressed forward returns. And we've almost seen the exact opposite. And in my head, I'm thinking to myself, well, is this sort of the recent research from ... and I'm going to butcher his name, but ... writ large, which is with this, there is no alternative type market, we're in that, people are moving away from fixed income to buy riskier assets.  T he positive realized returns has really just been a demand shock that's been realized. And so we're sort of -- it's hitting that escape velocity, that people are chasing the returns, they have to keep investing there because bonds keep getting less attractive. Even though they're selling bonds, bonds aren't getting more attractive, because central banks are keeping rates depressed, right? And so this is one of those like this is just going to continue, potentially until the marginal dollar stops having an impact. Adam:  00:21:25  That's sort of the inelastic market hypothesis or the precursor to that. Yeah. I mean, that's certainly a potential driver of this effect. And I wouldn't be surprised if it was a meaningful driver. And I think the state transition that we're experiencing, if there is a causal driver that you can point to, for me, is the shift from a purely monetary accommodative policy to now a combination of monetary and fiscal policy where you're now -- it's been financialization, which has driven growth exclusively over the past decade.

past decade. And that has benefited an increasingly smaller fraction of society. And now we're getting to the point where the political pressure is sufficient to, and probably catalyzed by some of the experiences during COVID, etc, that probably accelerated it.  But we've certainly seen a massive fiscal impulse over the last 18 months that we haven't seen in decades. We've got all of this talk in Congress, and not just in the US, but in a variety of major global jurisdictions that are now contemplating massive fiscal packages. And when you're beginning to take money out of the financial economy, and firehose it into the real economy, now you're going -- you have the potential for triggering demand for real assets, real durable goods, real consumption that just hasn't been there for the last 10 or 12 years. So that is really the trigger that I think the market is reacting to, as we're seeing market implied signals, that the market is concerned about an acceleration and unexpected inflation. Moving Off 60/40 YES/AND Rodrigo:  00:23:21  Well said, well said. That is, again, it's a good argument, it makes total sense. Now try to move people off their 60/40 right now. Right? So this kind of goes back to the point. Yes, there is a value there. Yes, it is. I've been doing this for 10 years, as in reducing my exposure 60/40 and I've gotten burned, so I'm going back to 60/40. So back to how do we get to kind of patch that up, and also give people what they need in that transition period? Because eventually we'll get to the point like we did in the early 00s or the mid-00s, where people underweighted US and overweighted BRICs, Brazil, Russia, India, and China. That's the place to be, right, the US was not the area you wanted to be in.  So, the paper was an attempt to do a yes/and, rather than there is only one way to diversify.

is only one way to diversify. And the yes/and was facilitated by these capital efficient ETFs and mutual funds that had come out, allowing us to really create a stacked approach to the P&L that we can grab from different asset classes. So we start in the paper, once we recognized that advisors are not benefiting from a lower single-digit return of alternatives, what you can do is, simple solution was, grabbing the Wisdom Tree, NTSX is the ticker, where they basically grabbed the 60/40 portfolio and levered it up 150%, right. So what you're getting when you buy, you give them $100, you are getting $90 of equity, and $60 of bonds. And what we showed in the paper was how when you grab NTSX since its inception, and only allot it 67 cents on the dollar, and compare it against 100 cents on the dollar to the Vanguard Balanced Fund, they are nearly identical. They're basically the same equity line.  But the difference to the user of that product is that you have increased 33% of your portfolio real estate, that you can do a myriad of things with, right? If you think the markets are overvalued, but you can't not participate, because your clients will fire you, you can just keep that in cash until the next COVID crash happens. And then you have all this dry powder to back up the truck in the asset classes and securities that you think are undervalued. That's one way to stack returns above that, what you would get from simply buying and holding the Vanguard Balanced Fund. Right, Corey? You also went through another approach to stacking, like with the bonds. Why don't you give everybody an example of that? Corey:  00:25:59  Yeah. The stacking examples we gave in the paper, were by no means prescriptive. They're just meant to be examples. But I think one of the questions that people often think about when they're facing a low return environment as well, okay, if my beta is going to give me a low return, how can I get some alpha?

I get some alpha? And so the question becomes, are you going to take your 60 and try to find managers that can consistently generate alpha for you over the next 5, 10, 15 years. And the evidence is very thin, particularly, in US large cap equities that you can find managers that can consistently do that. So one of the ways in which return stacking can be used is to get your core beta with 66 cents, and then use the other 33 cents to allocate towards different risk premia that should realize much more consistently.  So, for example, you could take those $33, that Rodrigo mentioned that you freed up and put them in very short term, high-quality corporate bonds. So, maybe they're going to give you 150 to 200 basis points a year, you get a 33% allocation, you end up with 60 bips. Well, now you get a 60/40 plus another 60 bips of returns on top, and that's coming from an extra 33% exposure to very short term very high-quality corporate bonds. That's a pretty attractive proposition, because I'm much more certain that that 30 bips or 60 bips, is going to be added on just about every year over the next 15 years, versus me being able to find an active manager that can add some alpha.  So, particularly, if you find an actively managed bond fund, where I think there's more evidence that alpha can be generated, I think you can use this form of return stacking, to basically try to pick places where you can add some excess return much more consistently. Mike:  00:27:59  You're muted, Adam. Leverage, at Institutional Rates Adam:  00:28:03  I want to bring this back to sort of some of the fundamental theory that everyone's familiar with in finance, right? I mean, go back to the 1950s, Harry Markowitz, and then Sharpe and Treynor, they sort of described an optimal portfolio allocation framework where you allocate to a maximally diversified portfolio or an optimal max Sharpe portfolio.

And then if that portfolio is not expected to deliver the returns you need, then you simply borrow at the risk free rate, and lever the portfolio up to generate that excess return that you require. It's very difficult for retail investors, for most advisors, even for small institutions to borrow using margin, for example, at rates that make that theoretical framework work in practice.  W hat's great about the setup, as designed by the Wisdom Tree ETF, for example, is you're using futures to achieve that leverage on that core portfolio, which means that you're borrowing at a rate that is consistent with what the largest, most liquid, most creditworthy institutions in the world are borrowing at. And you're able to use that borrowing rate to allocate to the other 33% of the portfolio. So the hurdle to generate an excess return on that 33% of the portfolio is as low as anyone can conceivably get, right. It's a very, very low hurdle, because you're borrowing at such a cheap rate. So almost anything that you layer on there, that has a reasonable probability of generating either a risk premium, or some sort of alpha is likely to be long- term accretive. I think that shouldn't be overlooked. Corey: 00:29:58  Yeah. That financing rate comment is really important, right? Because if we tried to do this, and I opened up like an Interactive Brokers account and tried to say, okay, I've got my 90% equity, and I want to borrow against my 10% collateral to buy Treasury futures, or whatever it is, or not Treasury futures to buy Treasury bonds, or something else, the borrowing rate they're going to give me is not going to be the financing rate that's embedded in Treasury futures. They're going to charge me a much more significant premium, which makes that hurdle rate we have to overcome with the returns of whatever we're stacking on top, that much higher. So a lot of the questions we've gotten is, well, does it matter what you lever up? And the way I look at it from a portfolio construction perspective is, operationally it kind of does sometimes.

does sometimes. But for the most part, you're looking at your long a big portfolio, and then you're short a financing rate. And your goal should be to get that financing rate as low as possible. So using things like Treasury futures, are not only potentially more tax-efficient than buying Treasury bonds, but the embedded financing rate is incredibly low. Rodrigo:  00:31:05  Yeah, and I will say that what's interesting is, if I can share my screen, I'll show you guys the, I think Figure 2. When we compare the 67 cents on the dollar onto NTSX, and the 33% in, not even cash. I literally just made a zero yield in cash in contrast to the Vanguard Balanced Fund. All right. I'm sharing right now. You guys see my screen? Adam: 00:31:41  We could. Now we can. Rodrigo:  00:31:44  All right. So Figure 4 in the paper shows the Vanguard VBINX Fund, this is the 60/40 fund, right next to $67 to NTSX and the rest in zero yielding cash. And the performance is identical. And this is because that product uses the cheapest possible leverage you can get on treasuries. If I had added 33%, if I added a cash yield on that, even though it's very low, you're going to be able to bump up your portfolio by that, whatever money market fund that you can find, right? So it is that cheap. This is not theoretical anymore. This is real life results of being able to apply this structural alpha to a product. Adam:  00:32:29  I want to make sure we acknowledge Amit's, sorry if I'm mispronouncing, comments about the fact that short-term corporates at the moment don't really provide any meaningful bump on cash, right? And obviously, this is true, corporate credit spreads are as narrow or almost as narrow as they've ever been. So this may not be the most optimal time to layer on with corporate spreads.

I think Corey's point stands, right? Like, yes, it's a narrow spread, but it's the spread, right. And the point broadly, is that you now have 33 cents of extremely efficiently levered capital to apply to other risk premia, or active sources of return, to stack on top of your core 60/40 return, so you can have your cake and potentially have a little bit of icing on top. Rodrigo:  00:33:31  Yeah, yeah. Reactions to Stacking Stacking – Reducing Risk Mike:  00:33:32  So what's been the reaction of folks when you go through that and talk about the leverage for their, whether it's allocators or individual advisors, how do they respond? Is it okay because the leverage is sort of cloaked? So it's not explicit, it's kind of built into some things. So they feel okay, or they can feel good, or they can get it through their compliance departments in parting this bit of leverage? What's been the pushback on the leverage? We know there's a great leverage aversion generally. So how have those conversations gone? Rodrigo: 00:34:10  Well, yeah, I think you get people who are kind of new to this concept. I mean this is a concept as old as time, right? But for the retail space, we've never had to have this conversation before, because it wasn't available before. So whenever you - this is why language is so important. I think it's helped us quite a bit to be able to talk about creating portfolio real estate, stacking those returns on top. That's helping quite a bit to get people across the line. But I think the first and most, the biggest kind of initial reaction is well, yeah, I'm stacking returns, but I'm also stacking a bunch of risk, right, you're levering up stuff. We're in an environment where I want to minimize and reduce risk for our clients. That's not kosher. I don't want to do that.

so we go quite a bit into the fact that we can stack returns while not necessarily stacking risk on top. In fact, if you do it the right way with the right products, you could reduce maximum drawdowns and keep the volatility relatively the same. And that's where a selection of your stack is important, right? We could have chosen a wide variety of elements to put into that 33%. But we chose strategies that have economic and behavioral reasoning for why they're likely to continue to provide diversification, and they have a structural non-correlation to bonds and stocks. And that's the futures space and the CTAs and systematic global macro, right?  So when you're able to stack on top something that has low correlation to your tracking or buys portfolio, then you can stack returns while not stacking risk. So once you get them through that, this idea of things zigging when they're zagging, and they're both making money, you start getting them excited. Adam:  00:36:07  Amit is making me excited. Come on. So Corey, here's the first good AMA question. Right? So, a certain pirate of finance, once said risk cannot be destroyed, only transformed. So is that what we're doing?  Corey:  00:36:20  I'm getting it thrown back in my face.  Adam:  00:36:22  Is it financial alchemy that you're proposing here or what's going on? Corey:  00:36:26  No, not at all. Look, I think when people think about leverage, let's acknowledge that just about every major financial catastrophe has involved leverage in some capacity, right? But it's often very concentrated leverage. So you look at Long-term Capital Management or the credit crisis of 2008. Yes, there was huge amounts of leverage that ultimately were a cause of the problem there. But it was leverage that was concentrated into a single bet. Right?

like to point out, almost everyone uses leverage in their day to day life. I f you borrowed to go to university, great, you're using leverage to invest in your human capital. If you used a mortgage to buy a house, great, you were using leverage to return stack real estate, very idiosyncratically, but real estate returns on top of your investment portfolio. Almost everyone uses leverage. If you invest in the S&P 500, the average company has like three turns of leverage, right? I mean, that's what we want them doing. We want them borrowing at low rates, to invest in growth opportunities, that's good use of capital. And yet, we don't want to do it with our own investment capital.  So the way I look at it, is I say, I can get a return stacked portfolio. We're not necessarily destroying risk, we can't destroy risk. But what we can do is say if I start with a 60/40, and I introduce some return stacking to say, add managed futures. Well, I think those managed futures are going to reduce the risk of my portfolio in an inflationary environment. But they're going to increase the risk of my portfolio potentially, in certain types of endogenous liquidity cascades, where there's forced margin calls, and everyone has to de-gross at the same time, you're just changing around where that risk is.  But I think the goal, ultimately, is that in using leverage, you can introduce excess return sources, and the added risk that you're adding on top is appropriate for the amount of extra return that you're getting. And you're not creating concentrated risk in one particular environment. It's not like we're saying, take all that extra real estate and invest in the riskiest stocks you can, right? It's trying to be an orthogonal source of returns, both from an asset class perspective, and structurally, the type of trades that are being made.

for this dream of orthogonal returns? What do we observe in some of the products out there now? Rodrigo:  00:39:11  Yeah. So, I think this kind of leads to the other objection when we first started talking about this initial example of NTSX being 66%, and then you're having the cash. The initial objection is, I can't put 66% of my clients’ money in that, or my own money in a single issuer. Right? And also, I get $33 in extra real estate. Is that enough to make a massive difference in my portfolio? I mean, Warren Buffett made all his money by buying high-quality stocks, but then levering up 1.6 times, right? So it's like a 1.6 turn seems quite reasonable, is 33% enough? Probably okay, but you can do better with now, and the availability of structured products.  C orey's fund is basically 75% equity, 75% bonds with some tail protection. You know, the fund that we sub- advise to Rational is the best beta through risk parity, and on top of that, we stack systematic global macro. It's another 100% on top. There's Millburn doing the same thing with traditional equities as their beta. You got Eric Crittenden also doing the same thing with SPY. So you all of a sudden, especially those using futures, because leverage is so cheap in that space, you're starting to see these beta plus alpha combinations that then allow you to minimize that objection, which is a line item risk objection, where you can put together seven to 10 different active managers using capital efficient strategies across different types of managed futures and a systematic global macro in a way where in the paper, we were able to get 1.6 leverage. 60% in alpha and 100% in the 60/40, right, in the traditional balanced portfolio, and that provided a pretty decent bump.

of the levered beta core, to make sure that people understand what's going on there. Because I actually had a lengthy email exchange with someone I consider to be a highly sophisticated investor, who ended up not really understanding about the mechanics of how NTSX works. For example, he thought that if the equity sleeve declined, then the portfolio would be overly exposed to treasuries, and didn't understand that there was going to be some notional rebalancing to keep the 90/60 equity/Treasury ratio intact along the way, right? So, Corey, I think you've maybe done the most digging on the underlying mechanics of that. So would you mind just going through what's happening in that portfolio?  Corey:  00:42:12  Sure. So NTSX, specifically, you can think of, it's an ETF, right, and they're going to take 90% of the money invested and invest in the S&P 500. So as an ETF, you get all the wonderful theoretical tax benefits of buying the underlying equities. And in the US, at least, the ability to wash out a lot of the taxable turnover that's happening in that passive exposure. And then the remaining 10% is being used to buy a ladder of Treasury futures. So 12.5 percent in two year, five year 10 year and 20 year, so equal notional amounts. And then the fund is being managed, I'm going to use air quotes for those who are just listening, and I'm going to say “actively” to maintain a 5% tolerance band around that 90/60. So when you get drift.  S o right now, for example, interest rates have been going up. Treasury futures have been declining in value every day, some of that cash is being swept out of the collateral amount. You're going to see a move away from that 90/60, maybe right now it's more like 95/55.

90/60. And conversely, let's say it's March 2020. Equities crash and bonds go up. Well, what it's going to do is it's going to start selling bonds to buy equities, right? Because it's again, drifting away from that 90/60 exposure. So it's just like a 60/40 in the very same way that when those weights get out of whack, it's just going to rebalance. I think we get confused by the Treasuries. But I think if you just think of this as a 60/40, that's just more. The logic makes a lot of sense.  Adam: 00:44:04  Yeah, 1.5 times the 60/40, right? So when you allocate two thirds of your capital to the 90/60, you end up with a full allocation to what is the equivalent effectively of the Vanguard Balanced Fund. And it, just like the Vanguard Balanced Fund maintains its relative exposures to stocks and bonds, this fund also maintains its relative exposures to stocks and bonds within the bands that you described, right? So you're maintaining that 60/40 quality throughout the cycle, which I think is critical.  Corey:  00:44:37  I think the key difference between something like this and the Vanguard Balanced Fund is, Vanguard Balanced Fund is going to buy the total bond market, right? It's not just US Treasuries, and it's not going to be in this notionally equivalent ladder across the yield curve. It's going to have asset-backed securities. It's going to have credit in there, it's going to have agency bonds. So a little bit of a different risk profile. But again, in the paper, we show 66 cents in an NTSX replicating portfolio versus the Vanguard Balanced Fund and they are incredibly close. Adam: 00:45:10  And you're able to benefit. I mean, the benefit of futures too, is you get this roll yield. Right?  Corey: 00:45:14  Right.

 00:45:15  Which is a nice little extra boost. And at the moment, this roll yield is competitive with investment grade credit spreads. Corey:  00:45:21  And potentially tax advantaged in the Treasury futures versus holding corporates. This is something people don't necessarily know is that Treasury futures are taxed at a 60% long term 40% short term rate, versus most of your return in something like the Barclays Aggregate is going to come from your income and the income distributions. And so the actual, there can be tax benefits to implementing your bond exposure with futures. Adam:  00:45:49  Yeah, so the after tax expected return is even more competitive with credit spreads. Yeah. Pasi is asking how often the NTSX rebalance happens, is that whenever the drift exceeds the band? Corey: 00:46:03  I believe it's when it's triggered, yeah.  Minimizing Excess Fees Adam:  00:46:05  Yeah. Yeah, I thought so too. What are some of the other objections? I know, one of the big ones, and Corey you sort of alluded to this earlier, was around the excess fees that you layer on to the portfolio when you take a third of the capital as an example and allocate to these alternatives. Have you found that there are return stacking alternatives that are able to substantially overcome the excess fees?  Corey:  00:46:44  Yeah. Before I get into the nitty gritty, practical implications, I think I'll just take a step back and say, again, I think this is a very rational conversation to have. In a low expected return environment, fees and taxes are two of the levers we can control that we know have a profound impact, right, a direct impact. So when you talk to someone who's a Bogle head, right, that's a two fund or three fund implementer is getting global market beta in a 60/40 for three or four basis points, it's hard to get them to move off that.

I try to communicate is, don't look at the line item, right? Look at the total portfolio composition, and what we're going to give you is the same 60/40, all right. So, think of that as your cake, and then the stacking is icing on the cake.  And the question is, are the extra fees that are getting put on for all the stacking, because a lot of these funds are more expensive, is it going to leave you with icing at the end of the day? As long as it leaves you with some icing, it's worth it, right? And so I think if you don't go line item by line item, but again, you think of it from a total portfolio composition, and Adam, you can talk to this. Like, you need to even incorporate some potential rebalancing benefits of return stacking, diversifying sources of return on. I think what you can find is, even if your actual average expense ratio of what you're holding goes up, there can still be substantial excess return that can be generated over the long run. Rodrigo:  00:48:17  Well, let's remember why people are so conscious of the fee, right? You get a lot of these studies that show what happens when you pay your advisor 1% if you get to keep that 1%. What's your terminal wealth look like? Right? It's not a little bit, it's a massive improvement, to reduce your fee from whatever you're paying, from 1% to zero, if you just do your Vanguard funds, right? Logical argument, makes total sense.  What happens if we grab that 60/40 portfolio and stack 1% return after all the fees, the poor management? If that portion that you stacked on top has mid-single digits, right, after fees, after poor management, let's say or like a bad decade, like we've seen in the last year, that portion, as long as it's about 1%, like any basis point above your 60/40 is going to have a massive impact to your terminal wealth, right.

you need to make room in your portfolio without leverage to add a non-correlated single-digit strategy, yeah, you're taking away from the future of your clients. When you are able to keep that and stack, whatever it is, it's a huge win. All of a sudden, something that's single-digit and kind of shitty, ends up being an amazing addition. Right?  So I think that, you know, we go through the paper, is it stacking, returns or is it stacking fees? Yes, everything's going to be a higher fee. But ultimately, you're getting a completely different asset class, much more sophisticated. You're getting access to leverage at the cheapest levels you can, professionally managed leverage, and you're getting the rebalancing premium that you get from having all these managers doing this internally. Corey:  00:51:11  Can I give a quick practical example of that? Right. So managed futures, which we talked about, had a really bad decade. Since 2011, the Credit Suisse Managed Futures Strategy, which is sort of pretty generic beta exposure, had an annualized return of 3.3%, with a number of years that it was down, right. But still, the net return was 3.3% after fees. So if you put 60% of that, on top of your 60/40, because you did return stacking, yes, maybe managed futures was disappointing if you had to sell equities to buy managed futures or sell bonds to buy managed futures. But when you talk about adding it on top as a diversifying source of return, suddenly that becomes very attractive even though it had a decade of very middling returns. Adam:  00:51:05  Mike, you were going to say something I think. You’re NOT Adding Risk Destroying Risk Mike:  00:51:05  Well, I was going to say that Corey explaining that, I think it's Frej Ornberg. I think that is partially answering that question, right? If you're levered anyway, no need to be scared or are the risks that you're adding multiplicative.

or are the risks that you're adding multiplicative. And they're not. That's the whole point, right? That as you add these, you have 100% exposure to the 60/40. It only costs you $67. So whatever you put in the basket of the 33, if it has a positive return, it is additive. And then you've got the diversity, right. And most of the funds that you've talked about in the paper, or the strategy types you've talked about in the paper, are structurally non-correlated to the 60/40. So this is where you can actually destroy risk. In a portfolio where you're adding streams of returns that are not correlated, structurally not correlated to the main basket, you do, in fact, increase risk adjusted returns over the very long term, while preserving all of the returns from the 60/40. And I think that's ... Rodrigo:  00:52:30  Yeah, I think that that objection -- well, you covered the objection broadly, but there's still always the real fear of everything correlating to one the wrong time, right? So there is something to be said about being levered, and everything just is completely offside at a time where there's a liquidity crunch, right? So I think that's something you do need to address. They're generally momentary, like we saw, I think, in the last three days of the drawdown in 2020. We saw it momentarily in 2008, as well. And so yeah, you need to consider that.  And the way we considered it is by when we were sourcing the different funds that went into the stack return kind of index. We sourced those that had a little bit of tail protection to really fill that gap, that need that you can go long volatility or you know, long convexity when things all go awry at the same time.

SPY, 40% was AG, 30% was the SocGen CTA Index and 30% was Goldman Sachs, Macro Factor Index. We didn't model in the tail protection and yet, from 2000 to today or to whenever we finished the report, the drawdowns were either better or slightly worse. It was, I think, slightly worse in 2020 without having modeled in the tail protection that a lot of these funds that we put in the paper have, right? So, you can imagine that adding that little extra juice there would help protect even further. So, it's not a necessary thing, but it is useful, I think. Mike:  00:54:25  I think the other side of it, Rod, is just to flip the question back and say okay, well what's the course of action? Is it just 100% 60/40, is that the solution? And then we come back to the very beginning of the conversation for all those reasons we talked about initially starting yield, starting valuations of all cash flowing assets being expensive. So, you're going to have to take some kind of risk. What is it that you would prefer to take, and how are you going to approach that? Corey: 00:54:51  So Mike, if I can add a comment because you saying you can destroy risk really made my skin crawl. I think I almost like, jumped across the screen.  Mike:  00:55:01  I wanted to trigger you.  Corey:  00:55:03  Yeah. So I think mathematically not to -- it's always tough to talk mathematics. But one of the things we can do is we can plot on like an X axis the amount of leverage we're using. And on the Y axis, we could plot the compound annualized growth rate of an asset when we apply that much leverage. So let's keep it really simple and say we're just buying stocks. At 100% leverage, aka, one for one exposure, you're going to get some compound annualized growth rate.

rate. And then what if you do that 1.2 times leverage? Well, maybe your growth rate goes up a little bit. 1.4 times, maybe it goes up a little more. But if you do 1.6 times, what you might actually find is your growth rate goes down.  What you actually tend to find is it sort of looks like this curve. And the more diversified the portfolio is, the more leverage you can get before you fall over the tip of that curve. Now, the goal would be estimating that curve requires a lot of assumptions. And so if we want to reduce model risk, we don't want to pinpoint the top of that curve, we want to probably be safely falling to the left side, taking too little leverage. So when we talk about a return stacked portfolio, that's 60%, equities, 40% bonds, 30% global macro, 30% CTA, what we're really talking about, is an unlevered portfolio that's like 37%, equity, 25% bonds, about 19% CTA and 19% global macro. A pretty well diversified portfolio, and then we're levering that up.  So the sort of technical approach we would want to take is, let's build that portfolio and then plot this graph and say, where is that peak? And we can use it doing historical numbers, or we can try to forecast in certain ways. But where's that peak where that's the optimal leverage point if we know the future? And are we safely to the left of that while still being above 100. And at least the way I worked out the numbers, 1.6 times levered on this well diversified portfolio still puts you safely to the left of maximum notional leverage. I mean, you look at a Sharpe parity portfolio, actually not Sharpe parity. You look at a risk parity portfolio, as you guys know, all too well, that leverage point can be, I don't know, 300% notional, because it's so well ... No, it depends on the target volume.

it depends on the target volume. You know what I'm saying. Adam:  00:57:27  No, but the point is your margin of safety is extremely large at 1.6 times leverage, based on that portfolio construction, right? The optimal peak on that portfolio is probably in the neighborhood of three to four times. And if you were to use the empirical, max Kelly is probably well north of that, right. So, this is an extremely prudent level of leverage contingent on the amount of structural diversity in the portfolio. End Mini-riff here Tracking Error Who Cares About Tracking Error? Mike:  00:58:01  So I also want to get back to a question that was asked earlier that I think we've now evolved to which is, what ideas do you have for this if you already understand structural diversification and don't really care about tracking error? Because we just started this risk parity conversation. So how would you guys think about that if tracking error is a much smaller behavioral bias?  Adam: 00:58:26  Well, hold on, haven't even talked about tracking error, really, actually. So let's talk about tracking error, like the importance of tracking error, why you decided to structure the paper this way rather than going in sort of a risk parity core direction. And then talk about for those who are less, who claim to be less tracking error sensitive, what are some alternatives? Mike:  00: 58:51  I think that's Ray Dalio’s pseudo name by the way. So I think -- Adam:  00:58:55  Yeah. Rodrigo:  00:58:56  Yeah, I think you know, when we first started talking about this, certainly my gut instinct was to stack returns by first creating the max Sharpe portfolio. So for every unit of risk you take, you maximize the unit of return, and then lever that up, right. But this has been our journey. Nobody likes - - a few people like to listen to that, right?

whole thing started because an advisor asked me, I'm trying to create a retail version of the All Weather, the Cockroach Portfolio, the Dragon Portfolio, can you help me, and I said no. Look what happens when I grab your equities, your bonds, your gold, your tail, you get a ... Adam: 00:59:39  Hold on. The answer is yes, I can help you with that. But no, you don't actually want it. You think you do, but actually, you don't. Rodrigo:  00:59:48  And I showed him I said, look, you let me do it. I did it on the screen for him and it did the back test for him. And what he saw was a high Sharpe, pretty steady equity line at a volatility of four with a return of four. That's like you're fired, you're fired, you're fired, it's just never going to happen. So I went to bed, and he kind of just gave up. And I woke up the next day and I'm like, hold on a second, with Corey's fund, with our fund, with Wisdom Tree, maybe we can create a levered version that hits, because the paper, like the Dragon Portfolio, has a volatility of 15% in the back test. Right. You need to lever that up pretty nicely. Why 15%? Well, because that's what equities run at. Right. So by being able to use leverage with these products, I was able to go back to him and say, look, here's your Dragon Portfolio, using leverage that hits like 8-9% volatility, which is probably, okay, you're still going to struggle with a lot of tracking error, but, okay.  A nd we started thinking about publishing this paper, and I realized, this individual, this advisor is unique. Very, very few conversations happen when somebody's seen the light. Almost every conversation is about how do I minimize my tracking error, while also recognizing I need diversification?

Can you help me, right? And so, with the Stacking Returns paper, we could have gone both ways. But it made sense to us to address the biggest market, to try to help the people that are most susceptible to this future possible negative path for equities and bonds. And it made sense to do this, to create something that minimize the tracking error. People ask us if that's what we do with our money. No, we're converts, right? This is ... Adam: 01:01:28  Mike, how does this leveraged 60/40 allocation make you feel? Mike:  01: 01:35  Oh, God. Oh, God. Well, yeah, it makes my skin crawl a little bit much like Corey's, me saying destroying risk. And I don't mean that in a -- I mean, that for me, personally. I just think that we are reaching a point of peak 60/40, especially when it comes to North American markets. And I've just been around for a couple of decades, a few decades doing this. And I've just seen the markets, how they sort of lull everybody into a concept, until the last dollar of that concept goes in. And there's a decade-long period where things don't work like was expected. So if we think about the 2000 Peak that started with the 1982 bull market, which started with interest rates at 18%, and brought them down to 6%. And how the conversion happened for people owning bonds and then getting convinced on stocks. The Japanese experience into 89. Like, I've just seen it so many times. And when you get such broad, vehement adoption, that equity risk premia, especially that of North America, and the US is clockwork, it works like a bond. It works like a CD or a GIC. When you get that kind of confidence, that's where I get really uncomfortable. At the same time, I totally understand how advisors, allocators, board members are compelled to dance whilst the music plays.

Very few can stand against the zeitgeist. And so I think that was the birth of this, the light bulb that went over in Rod and Corey's head. Go ahead. End Mini-riff here Advisors’ Liability Corey:  01:03:25  No, I love that idea because one of the things that -- after you write a paper like this, I always find you get to talk to a lot of interesting people and you get feedback. And Mike, your point there, that people can't stand against this. One of the ways I've been thinking about advisors in the 60/40 portfolio is you can almost think of the 60/40 portfolio as the advisors' liability. If they don't deliver returns in line with the 60/40 portfolio, if they deviate too far negatively they get fired, right?  And so to me, another way of rethinking this return stacking is look, the first thing we're going to do is we're going to hedge your liability. You as an advisor have a liability that if you don't return 60/40 you're in trouble. We're going to hedge your liability as capital efficiently as possible. And then we're going to add something on top, and it's very much like a pension in that sense. It's just I'm looking at the advisor's business.  Now, again, we're using 60/40 as the example here. Does it have to be 60/40? No, you can do this in other ways. The reality is from a $1 basis the vast majority of money that advisors have for the clients they have ends up in a 60/40 balanced portfolio. So, it's just sort of the biggest target market for us to address with this example. But to me, the point was, the advisor has a liability in this return stream. Hedge the liability, add whatever else you want on top. Mike:  01: 04:48  Yeah, I like that framework. So, I remember talking to Justin Castelli about this topic, right.

client, if you're an advisor, has a behavioral tracking bias. We're talking to the largest market with the 60/40. But if you happen to live in San Francisco, that tracking error bias is going to be to a different main piece of finance, whatever it is. If you're in a city, where everybody owns the company's stock, I mean, you're in an Apple complex, you're at the Googleplex, that's going to be the tracking error that you're going to have to deal with. So I think if this expands, this concept extends far beyond 60/40. If you're dealing with an individual who has a large single stock position, how might you diversify that large single stock position?  In fact, we have a few clients in that very spot where they have a large stock position with an extremely large tax liability that they don't ever want to sell. So how might you use the excess margin available on those assets, in order to stack returns and diversify the returns if you're never going to sell the asset? So, this is much more broadly applicable. And one of the things that an advisor, an allocator board member is tasked with doing is understanding what the tracking error sensitivity is, to the end investor that they're dealing with. That's the first prescription or the first thing that has to be determined by that individual? And then how do you go about bringing them to a more responsible place, if you will, that tracks their main index but provides excess returns? Anyway, go ahead. Rodrigo:  01:06:34  It was the idea that our whole careers has been about, we're smarter than you. The math is very clear. This is the way to manage money for 100 years, and there is no other way. Look at how intelligent I am. Why aren't you doing this? But the truth is that we were dumb, because we didn't take into account the utility curve of the individual investor, which has a behavioral bias, all types of behavioral bias.

behavioral need for belonging in a society where everybody's winning and losing and at the same time, you need to put those two together, right? Our job, it's presumptuous for us to think that everybody should do this one thing.  O ur job as stewards of wealth, is to put together a portfolio where the end client is most likely to stick to long term, period, full stop. Right? Because you can provide a max Kelly type of investment strategy that helps you compound wealth at the highest rate, but nobody's going to stick to that. Right? So why does it matter? Why are we even talking about it? And I think that this is a recognition of that, a recognition that there is a need for this. And our job is to help people do the best that they can with what they have. Right? Tolerated Tracking Error Beta and Portable Alpha Adam:  01:07:59  Okay. So we started, Mike actually started this and I sort of backed it up a little bit. But he started by saying, for those who can tolerate a larger tracking error and are pursuing a more absolute return-type wealth trajectory, how might they begin to think about this problem from a beta and portable alpha type framework? Rodrigo: 01:08:31  Well, again, I think we cover a lot of this, but there's a bunch of different ways. I think Meb Faber talked about -- he did a horse race between the permanent portfolio risk parity, Mohamed El-Erian. I'm sure you can add more things. I mean, certainly the way we like to approach it, which is a bit of risk parity, a portion of long/short commodities, systematic global macros, some tail protection is an All Weather approach to maximizing your Sharpe ratio, right? So there's no, there doesn't seem to be one answer to all of this, really.

and you find whatever that optimal All Weather, ensemble of All Weather strategies are. Well, now you can lever that up, right? And so what we're working on is trying to put together some sort of widget, hopefully soon, that has what we believe to be the underlying exposures across many different public funds, where you can type in this is the allocation I want, and this is the leverage I want. And it spits out how to put together these public ETFs and mutual funds to give you the exposures that you want at different levels of leverage, right?  So I think, from my perspective, a thoughtful approach would be that, source strategies where people are calling them All Weather, see if you like them, put them together, find the allocation, and then at this point, the widget isn't up and running. But certainly, you can reach out to us and we can help you structure that using these public funds in a way that is useful to you, whether you're an individual investor or an advisor. Corey, do you have any thoughts on that? Corey:  01:10:22  Yeah, just I would say the tough part today is still that there's not a plethora of funds that do this. And because leverage was historically a four letter word and probably still is, they don't advertise that they do this return stacking. So coming up with a list of funds that actually do the return stacking, I think, Rodrigo, you and I put together maybe a list of 20 total. That said, the SEC rules changed as of last November or last October as to how much notional leverage can be used in a 40-F fund. It's now based on value at risk.  S o just as an example, it used to be if I wanted to take two year US Treasury futures and lever them up 10 times and put it into an ETF, I couldn't do that, even though that was probably the equivalent duration risk of me just taking that ETF and buying 20 year US Treasuries, which was allowed. So now the SEC has changed their tune.

it's not about notional leverage, it's about your value at risk. And so my expectation would be there's going to be a lot more funds that are incorporating derivatives providing you a lot more bang for your buck. I think you'll see different currency strategies coming to market, a lot more in the Treasury futures space, commodity futures, hopefully. Because a lot of these strategies that could be done in hedge funds really got neutered when they were putting 40- F vehicles. Doesn't answer your question as to what should people do if they want more tracking error, I'll gladly admit, as a US investor, it is hard for me to fight that US country bias. I have not become a full convert to something like risk parity.  But what I've done with a lot of my money, I just have a lot of US equities that have a low cost basis, I really can't sell them. They're in taxable accounts. I'm sort of stuck with them for the long run. A lot of what I've been working towards is with marginal new money, trying to implement this return stacking via Treasury futures, and then using the freed up capital to buy things like managed futures, and strategies or private funds that I might have access to that I think give me a really good diversifying source of return. End Mini-riff here Who Cares About Tracking Error? Mike:  01:12:24  I think you actually have to ask the question, sort of above the, what do I do if I'm okay with tracking error? Well, the question really is, what do you believe about markets, asset classes, their returns and the risk, right? So if you embark on different types of strategies, like a risk parity strategy is saying that the return of the asset is directly related to the risk or the volatility that it has. And that is the underlying basic assumption. And then you can go through a minimum variance has a different set of assumptions, you can go through things like, well, how good you think your forecasting is on various asset classes, as you assemble the portfolio.

I think probably Adam, you can wax and wain on this a little bit more. But the, what's the paper that you wrote that really goes through that in detail about ... Adam:  01:13:22  Yeah, The Portfolio Optimization Machine. Yeah. Mike:  01:13:23  Right. Right. Which is, if you haven't read that, that would help answer that question. I don't care about tracking error. Okay, that's fine. What do you believe about markets? And then going through The Portfolio Optimization Machine, there's a framework there where you go step by step and you make decisions? Do I believe this, or do I believe that? And you go through the decision tree, and then lo and behold, you will have a decision where now your beliefs are congruent with what you're reflecting into your portfolio. And that should be the base of beta on which you would stack returns, if I were to think about a framework to put that through. Corey:  01:14:03  Can I add just one thing to that, which I would say I don't think it's enough discussion is, human capital is an asset. And most people can model their human capital as some sort of bond, corporate bond. And you can decide whether, how sensitive it is to default and that sort of stuff. But the reality is, a lot of us are like, if you don't work in financial markets, in particular, very long, a corporate bond that should be taken into account in all of this discussion, right?  When you're thinking about your investments and the liabilities you're trying to meet in the future, it should not just be about your investment capital. It should be about the combination of your human capital, which is likely modeled as a bond, plus your investment capital. And if you can keep that holistic framework in mind, right, you can probably get rid of a lot of bonds if you're young, out of your investment portfolio, because you have this huge long duration bond, that is your human capital.

portfolio for someone who's approaching retirement is because their human capital duration sort of goes away and turns into an option of sorts, right? They have the option to go back to work. So I think for those who can maybe think a little bit more holistically about their financial planning, which is probably anyone listening to this podcast, especially if you got to an hour and 15 minutes in, right, I would urge you to consider how that human capital element plays into it as well.

And even if you're young, you just need to be willing to take on as much leverage and volatility as you can stomach and be responsible with, right, in that All Weather strategy.

and a half percent, what's the point? Well, bonds are yielding one and a half percent if you invest 100 cents on the dollar. But if you're able to lever them up three times, then all of a sudden that one and a half percent return levered three times rivals that risk premium of equities, right? So if you put them in the right proportion with some commodities, and you are a young person, your bond as an individual that's idiosyncratic added to that, and you use leverage, that's actually, for me, a better option than what is commonly told to do which is the 100% equity portfolio. I think ...  Corey:  01:17:33  NFTs, baby. Mike:  01:17:35  A little close to home ... from yesterday, dude, NFTs. Rodrigo:  01:17:40  You know, that concentration risk, you can invest like an old person as long as you have leverage because then you'll be like an old, very diversified portfolio with a lot of volatility and risk and return, right. So when you think about the Vanguard or whatever, any lifecycle fund, that starts with 100% equities and ends with 100% bonds. And if you're looking at the Sharpe ratio of that portfolio, it starts very low because it's in equities, historical Sharpe ratio is 0.3, then as you add more bonds to it, the Sharpe ratio starts going up to 0.5. And as you get older and start to decumulate, the Sharpe ratio goes back to 0.3. It's an absurd way of managing life cycles.  And there's also a sequence of return risk from that portfolio, right? If you look at the 60/40 portfolio, over the last 100 years, there's many decades where you're annualizing at zero in real returns, right? The best way to do it is to have that All Weather, and keep that same allocation, but start at 20 vol risk parity.

when you're retired, finish up at non-levered risk parity and maintain your Sharpe ratio as consistent as you possibly can. That's the next fund we should launch. Adam:  01:18:52  Corey, Rick Hanes asked if you saw ... the 200 SMA approach -- Corey:  01:18:57  Don't ask me this Mike:  01:18:59  Before we jump on to that one, I just want to wrap up on the All Weather side. So Adam, when you asked me what do I think about Return Stacking, it really is a relationship to the concentration in the S&P/US sort of balanced portfolio that makes my skin crawl. If it was based on an All Weather type portfolio structurally diversified, you know, pick what assumptions you want, I would feel a lot better. That would be my preference. And that's what we run in our products.  I also think people, investors, allocators, etc, should be thinking about the fact that we have a debasing of the monetary system that's going on, while at the same time rates are pinned at all time low levels. And if you're an investor that is in that world, how might you take advantage of that for your own investing purposes? Let's not even think about tracking error. H ow would I maximize returns? I'm a return seeking maniac. Well, I would borrow all the money I could at these insanely low, the cost, I would try and get as much non-recourse leverage as I could. And then I would try and construct a very diversified portfolio. And so you've got this set of circumstances that is laid at your feet, because central banks have done some things and stuff.  But you do have to think about the regime shifts that come through those periods of time where we've seen pinned rates, debasement of currencies in the past. They have occurred in the past, there are very different asset regimes. But what you're saying with All Weather is I'm not sure how that's going to manifest to  someone and when it's going to transition.

to transition. And then when you're stacking on top, you're adding all those other types of asset classes that aren't so commonly held, other types of strategies, and you're doing it at almost free, in cost. Like when rates are much higher, if rates are 10%, it's a little harder to do.  Adam:  01:21:04  Yeah, for sure. So, about that 200 SMA. Mike:  01:21:09  Yeah. Timing, Luck and ROMO Rodrigo:  01:21:12  Sorry, Rick. What's happening here is that we've written, Corey has written a ton on the timing/luck issue of any sort of rebalancing, any sort of trigger points, like 200 days, what's so special about the 200 day? What about the 100 day, 150 day, the 300 day. Newfound and ReSolve co- created an index based on research that we came to at the same time with regard to maximizing the different types of trend signals that you can get, because no one can really foresee which one's going to be better in the next period, you want to have them all. And you want to minimize your timing luck, you want to maximize diversification strategies. And that creates a much more robust portfolio where you're not susceptible to any particular type of market.  So you want to be broadly correct about your signals rather than specifically wrong. And I think Corey has some examples in his back pocket on where the 200 day or the 10 month momentum signal is specifically wrong, and why you want to diversify away from that. So you can look it up, Timing Luck, ROMO or the Robust Momentum Index that we run. All the research is there on Corey's website.  Corey:  01:22:42  Thank you for saving me from doing that.

addressed, I don't know if I can select it. But from Mike Caldwells, who was asking if there's any due diligence considerations, when looking at these publicly available funds? I think that's a great question, whether you're an advisor or an individual. So Rod, I don't know if you want to jump in, Adam, Mike? Rodrigo: 01:23:09  No, I think it's a good question for you, Corey. Corey:  01:23:11  Oh, great. So I think with any of these funds, the first couple questions to ask are going to be, first of all, what are the assets that are within it? Are they passively managed? Or are they actively managed because these different strategies are doing this in different ways. So we mentioned the Wisdom Tree NTSX portfolio, that's very vanilla. That's going to be 90% equities. 10% cash 60% notional exposure to Treasury futures. Contrast that with something like PIMCO Stocks Plus, which is going to be bonds as the base, and then overlaid with about 100% notional exposure to the S&P 500, through futures.  So what's important in trying to understand what's going on in the construction is going to be cost, it's going to be tax consideration. So you know, you're getting wonderful 60/40 treatment on your Treasury futures with NTSX, but in PIMCO stocks plus, you're getting 60/40 treatment on the S&P 500, which is a typically worse tax than if you were just buying and holding S&P 500 exposure. So understanding which asset is getting levered up, the implied financing costs of levering up that asset, whether it's actively or passively managed, and the tax implications, are I think, are hugely, hugely important. Another product that's out there is the DoubleLine Shiller Enhanced CAPE product mutual fund. I think I got that right.

 01:24:47  Which is actively managed bonds with a total return swap on top that's based on an actively managed equity index. So again, it's the same sort of concept, stocks plus bonds levered up. But now it's not passive equity and passive treasuries, it's active bonds and active equity. And so you have to decide not just do you want this total leverage exposure, but how are they actively managing the bonds? How are they managing the collateral? How are they actively managing this equity index, and how do they play together? And so you have to be really careful when you look at these different products as to how the pieces are actually fitting together, and the tax considerations thereof. Rodrigo: 01:25:29  And you want to reach out to the managers because like Corey mentioned earlier, a lot of people aren't very public about the leverage they're using. They don't use the word leverage in these funds. They'll talk about we have a 95% exposure to S&P. And then we have with the last 5%, we do a swap of some sort to get extra exposure to blah, blah, blah. So you're not often getting a direct communication as to what type of leverage and how they're using the leverage. You have to call, you have to dig, and you have to get the right answer, right.  S o since this paper has come out, a lot of people that have been hiding are coming out of the closet with their leverage, right, and saying, oh, I want to be part of your list all of a sudden, right? Hopefully, we're making it cool again, to talk about capital efficiency. But yeah, you do need to make the call, and you also need to diversify your manager risk. So we launched an index, based on the paper, in our website, if you go to InvestReSolve.com, go to strategies, and then in the indices, or Stacking Return Indices, you'll see a version of the Stack 60/40 Portfolio and the managers that are chosen there.

a lot of them are overlapping managers, right? There's two managed futures funds. Why do you want to do that. Because managed futures are notoriously divergent, like they're not all going to give you the exact same type of trend, speaking of the 200 day moving average. So you have the opportunity here to diversify manager risk as well, while getting those stacked returns, right. So that's, I think, a key thing, diversify your line item risk.  And then the other discussion and objection that we've had, especially with dealing with advisors that want to implement something like this, is that ultimately, when they go to their compliance and say, look, I have a model portfolio. Look at these 10 line items, I want to do this, they're going to go search for those line items and see that there are alternative funds. And that will be like, at first blush, it'll seem like it's 100%, high risk, can't do it. Right? So advisors are working with a compliance team to explain the concept. And what we've suggested is not to say, listen, you should replace what you're doing. And just do this because it's going to be a tough ask, you got to get compliance on board.  What we're suggesting is create a brand new sleeve with a bit of assets. Convince one or two of your clients or yourself to do it. And let the numbers speak for themselves over the next three years, and slowly educate. Let people opt into this solution as time goes by because it is a compelling implementation. It is what institutions are doing. The most sophisticated people and institutions on the planet have been doing this for decades, and that's why they're crushing everybody in terms of returns; the Canadian Pension Plan, the Ontario Teacher’s Pension Plan. This is institutional quality concepts that eventually will show up in the numbers.  So yeah, the truth is that ultimately, you got to address the fact that it's all alts, that there is leverage, you got to get your compliance behind it, and then you I think you need to let people opt

Adam:  01:28:36  Poor Amit keeps asking for the list of tickers.  Mike:  01:28:40  We can't be more clear, we keep putting the link in there.  Adam:  01:28:43  We keep posting them. Yeah, maybe Ani just for posterity. Drop that link to the Stacking paper.  Mike:  01:28:51  I dropped it in as well on the thing. But yes, it's in there a couple of times.

So the premise here was motivated by a conversation we had on this show with Chris Schindler a few months back, which I highly recommend that you go and listen to. The full thing is absolutely mind-blowing. And there's 100 different amazing takeaways that would be accretive for most investors.

too many individual managers that each run their own independent strategy. And the benefits accrue from three different sources.  The first source is that when you run a variety of strategies in a single fund, then a lot of the times the trades that you're putting on in order to execute on each of those strategies are orthogonal to one another, which means that often they will be netted, right. So, one strategy will be going long a market and another strategy will be going short the market. And if you're running them in the same account with the same fund, you don't buy and then sell, you just net the exposure. So your average trading is a lot smaller than it would be if you are running them in separate accounts, or in separate funds, right. And so you're paying less commission and you've got less trade slippage.  The second is that you're paying performance fees, right. So a lot of the time, these are active strategies that have performance fees, and the performance fees you're paying are on two different things. One is the skill of the manager, and one is the noise of the strategy. Well, when you combine a bunch of strategies together, the noise, a lot of the noise, cancels out. So the noise term in that equation is much lower, and the proportion of the signal is much higher. So you end up paying a higher proportion of your performance fees on skill, and a much lower proportion of the performance fees on noise. And so your aggregate total performance fees paid is a lot smaller when you mix all of these strategies in a single fund, rather than when you have them across multiple different independent accounts or funds or strategies.  And the third source is a little bit more nuanced. But consider a typical allocation to alternatives, let's just say you've got 70% in a core portfolio, you're going to take 30% of the portfolio of your capital, and allocate it to alternatives.

your total risk budget is substantially less than 10%, because when you combine all of these funds together, they're uncorrelated, you get diversification of the total portfolio, volatility goes down, and your expected returns goes down commensurately.  When you combine them all in a single portfolio, then if you don't re-leverage them, then the returns go down. But when you combine them, you can then rescale the total combined strategy back up to the original target risk, which means you're then getting a substantial boost to your target return, or to your expected return.  So the combination of those three different things in the case studies that we examined resulted in about a 50% boost to expected performance from allocating to a multi- strat fund or multi-strat product, rather than allocating to a series of individual products where each product is trading independently, paying fees independently, and you don't have the opportunity to rescale the total portfolio risk to achieve that potential target return. So, that's coming out in the next few weeks.  Mike:  01:34:10  Beautiful. Well, we took it from the beginning to the middle and left them on that Star Spangled Banner note right there at the end leaving them, obviously, with bated breath for the next papers that are coming out. Corey: 01:34:25  Can I just say I'm actually really excited about that paper, Adam. I think this industry focuses far too much on the next source of alpha when stuff like that is a structural edge when you think about it correctly, and is an edge that cannot be diminished. Right? You either do it correctly or you do it incorrectly. And if you do it correctly, it's not something that crowding can get rid of. You are literally tilting all the odds in your favor, and I think that kind of stuff doesn't get enough play in this industry. Adam: 01:34:56  You know, it's so nuanced because we talked about this a lot internally, because all of our strategies are massive multi-strats. Right?

what that means is you are eliminating to the greatest extent possible, the luck component, right, that noise component, which is maybe your strategy specification just happens to get really lucky in a year. And the vast majority of investors misperceive that luck as skill and then your fund gets a massive amount of inflows, and it can make a career, right? Some really good luck, that's 99% of the time, just noise, makes careers, right? And we have shorted that opportunity in order to be able to maximize the efficiency of portfolios.  A nd so what it means is, we expect to sort of be in the second quartile all the time, and almost never in the first quartile because we just don't have that luck, that excess noise factor that gets you into the top quartile, right? The reality is, funds that spend some time in the top quartile are a lot more likely to spend time in the bottom quartile, right? And it's that moving from top quartile and the bottom quartile that ends up leaving investors with very mediocre returns over time. What you want is a fund that spends most of its time in the second quartile, never spends time in the bottom quartile. And that compounding effect ends up paying off to a massive amount of excess wealth over time.  So anyways, it's a really interesting business decision, investment decision for the allocator. You have line item risk, you've got single custodian risk, single operations risk, there's all kinds of things to consider. But I think this is an important concept.  End Mini-riff here Manager Turnover and Returns Mike:  01:36:52  Did you touch on the actual manager turnover, right? So you've got these 10 non-correlated managers. You will absolutely have one that provides a 15 or 20% loss. And if you fire them at that point, that's the asset that you had, and the performance fee is now gone, you have to hire a new manager at the new fresh performance fee.

guarantees a turnover of managers that increases the overall performance fee paid. Adam:  01:37:24  Yep. And a lot of advisory firms have these arbitrary thresholds. If an alternative fund violates a 15% drawdown limit, that fund is automatically removed from the recommended list, a new fund is there to replace it. And all that means is advisors are forced to sell that fund, that's in a drawdown. Keep in mind, the investors in that fund have accrued an asset. That asset is the value of the difference between the high water mark on the fund and where the fund currently is in drawdown, they're giving that up. Now they're going to go buy a new fund, that high water mark is reset at the purchase price. And you rinse and repeat so there's a massive accrual of negative, or giving up on positive fee assets. Corey:  01:38:13  What about the tax asset you create though? You know what, I'm not even going to go there. We could go another hour. Mike:  01: 38:18  You make a fair point, right? You have it, potentially a tax asset but many of these assets are, let's face it, these are endowments and whatnot. So there isn't tax deferred products.  Corey: 01:38:27  Great point.  Mike:  01:38:28  You're right. If you do have a tax asset, it's something that you need to consider. But a 20% free ride up to your high water mark, and abandoning that just through randomness, right? If you have 10 managers with a one Sharpe and they're not correlated, and you have this metric, some of them are just going to hit the part of the bell curve that knocks them out for nothing, but just random noise. Adam:  01:38:53  Well, the majority of it's just noise. Absolutely. Yeah. It's complete foolishness. Mike:  01: 38:57  Right. And as Rick says, good to investment when it drops 15%.

That's precisely right. Right? Review the manager, if nothing's changed, it's a normal drawdown, rebalance, add more. If it's broken, okay, sell but that's a very different, you know, I think broken is often confused ... Adam:  01:39:18  One day we'll have an hour and a half conversation of what being broken means. Mike:  01:39:22  Exactly. Precisely, which it needs at least that, at least that.  Adam:  01:39:27  Yeah, for sure.  Mike:  01:39:28  Well, gentlemen. Rodrigo:  01:39:29  All right, gentlemen. Are you guys all joining me for the private screening of Dune this Sunday? Mike:  01:39:33  Yeah, I'm in I mean, I ... Adam:  01:39:35  I've got to run it by my boss. Mike:  01:39:36  I absolutely said to my boss that I might be missing at 10 o'clock on Sunday. I'll try and get you a ticket. Adam:  01:39:45  It's not this Sunday, right, it's next Sunday? Corey:  01:39:45  If my boss can't show up, I'm not allowed.  Rodrigo:  01:39:48  Yeah, it's this Sunday. Mike:  01:39:49  Yeah, I didn't tell my boss.  Rodrigo:  01:39:53  That's why it's a private screening.  Mike:  01:39:54  ... dammit. Adam:  01:39:57  Anyway, thank you guys so much for listening.

Stacked Checklist - final In this video, I want to go through my return stacking checklist. These are the nine things that I go through anytime I'm working on a return stacking mandate for my clients. I'm going to go over all the points in this video, but you can also find this checklist at returnstacked. com slash checklist. So the first thing I always think about is figuring out what I want to stack in the portfolio. This is going to be based upon not only what's already in the portfolio, which is typically stocks and bonds, but also the type of return profile an investor is looking for. Are they looking to, uh, stack something unique, an alternative, or are they looking to just find a little bit of incremental return that they have a high degree of confidence in? My personal bias and preference is typically to only stack things that I think have a high degree of certainty of introducing a really diversified return into the portfolio. So, for example, most portfolios I start with already have stocks and bonds. I'm not looking to add more stocks and bonds, and I'm not looking to add things that are going to have a high degree of correlation to stocks and bonds, either on average or In the tails, right? So much of portfolio risk is dominated by what happens when equities have a big bear market. I want to make sure whatever we're layering on top, I have a high degree of confidence is going to behave independently. Now, the second thing we want to consider is what I'll call our hurdle rate. And this helps us identify what we can actually stack. It's important to acknowledge that when we're stacking, we are implicitly borrowing money. Now, through markets like futures and swaps and forwards, the implied borrowing rates are some of the cheapest available anywhere. But it is there and it's something we have to consider. And not just the implied financing rate that we have to overcome, but also the costs and fees associated with any funds we might implement through, as well as the taxes.

whatever we stack on top has to overcome before it can add any value to our portfolio. So the third thing we want to think about is how big do we want the stack to be? The size of the stack is gonna have a really big influence on the portfolio impact, both in the potential added returns as well as the potential added risk. As a really simple rule, if you take the size of the stack, and multiply it by the volatility of whatever you're looking to stack on top. That's going to give you a general idea about the potential added risk, as well as the potential added tracking error you're going to create. So just as a really simple example, let's say you wanted to stack on top of your portfolio, a managed futures program that had a 15% volatility, and you wanted to add a 10% stack. Well, if you take that 10% and multiply it by 15, you get 1. 5. So, it sort of tells 1 you worst case scenario, you're going to add at least 1. 5% to your portfolio volatility, as well as create 1. 5% tracking error from whatever that underlying benchmark is. Now, on the other hand, if you were looking to stack, say, short term corporate bonds that had a volatility of just 3% with the same stack size, well, 10% times 3% equals 0. 3%. So, your added portfolio volatility is only 0. 3%, your added tracking error is only 0. 3%. You could, in theory, have a much bigger stack of a lower volatility asset and not even incur as much added risk. as a smaller stack of a higher volatility asset. So what you're stacking can ultimately heavily influence the appropriate size of the stack. Now I mentioned this was sort of a worst case rule. Look, if you have an all equity portfolio and you stack more equity, all you're going to do is add risk. But if you have an all equity portfolio and you stack, say, bonds, or you stack managed futures, which have historically had a very low correlation, well, on average, you might actually find portfolio volatility goes down.

you're looking to explore how different asset combinations and stacks have worked together to either increase or decrease, Portfolio volatility historically. We have a return stacking visualizer tool that is available on our website. You can head to returnstacks. com slash tools. All right, checklist item number four. We're gonna start talking about imple- mentation and one of the things we need to consider is how we're actually going to implement the stack. So number four is determining whether the exposure we want already exists as a stacked fund, right? Let's say we wanted to implement a managed futures stack. Well, there exist funds out there that for every dollar you invest will give you say a dollar of bonds and a dollar of managed futures, or they'll give you a dollar of stocks and a dollar of managed futures. And so the point here is you're looking for generic managed futures exposure Well, those funds exist and you can very easily add that stack on top by just selling either stocks and bonds and buying the appropriate pre stacked fund. That's not true for every exposure. Or even if it is true for a particular exposure, you may want to implement with a specific manager. So, for example, there may be pre stacked bond and equity plus managed futures funds available. But there might be a specific managed futures manager you want to use who does not offer a pre stacked solution. In which case, we have to go to checklist item number five. So checklist item number five says, if the exposure we want does not exist in a pre stacked fund, we need to figure out how to make room for it in the portfolio. Now typically this is going to involve selling some stocks, selling some bonds, and buying some sort of capital efficient stock bond exposure. 2 So let's say for a moment that there is a 100 100 stock bond. This is the only fund that exists. For every dollar you invest, you get a dollar of stocks and a dollar of bonds. This sort of fund would enable you to do something like sell 10% of your stocks...

10% of your capital would be freed up. But because that fund gives you a dollar of stocks and a dollar of bonds for every dollar invested, you are retaining the stocks and bonds exposure that you sold. And then with that remaining 10%, you're free again to invest in whatever you want. But again, what's critical here is recognizing that if the pre stacked exposure doesn't exist, we need to figure out how we're going to sell stocks and bonds with a combination of buying a capital efficient stock bond exposure to free up the amount of the stack size we want. Checklist item number six, we need to make sure that our betas match. What does that mean? Well, I've talked about two ways in which return stacking can be implemented. In the first way, we're buying a pre stacked fund. And in the second way, we're selling stocks and bonds and using a capital efficient stock bond fund to make room in the portfolio. What's really important here is making sure that whatever we sell matches up with the exposure we're getting in those capital efficient funds. So let's go back to our example of a fund that for every dollar you put in, you get a dollar of bonds and a dollar of managed futures. And let's say those bonds are broad U. S. Treasuries. Well, you wouldn't want to sell short term U. S. Treasuries to then buy that fund because the exposure you would end up with afterwards would be a mismatch from what you had before. Similarly, if you're selling stocks and bonds to buy a capital efficient stock bond exposure, you want to make sure those stocks and bonds are of a similar nature. Similarly, you probably don't want to sell foreign developed stocks and, say, high yield bonds to buy a capital efficient stock bond fund that's going to give you S& P 500 exposure and diversified U. S. Treasuries. Doing so would create a significant mismatch in the pre and post stacked portfolio profiles. Alright, checklist item number seven is, before you actually think about pulling the trigger on implementing a return stack portfolio, you really want to be thoughtful about what the worst case risk

about what the worst case risk scenario is. Now we always try to advocate for stacking assets that zig when the underlying portfolio zags, but we really like this language of return stacking. Because it reminds us that we're just adding returns together at the end of the day. And if both of those returns are negative, then we're going to be worse off than had we just not stacked in the first place. So before we go through with any stacking, we really want to make sure what those potential worst case scenarios are. When could that underlying portfolio 3 and whatever exposure we're looking to stack on top both lose money at the same time? And then how can we appropriately set the stack size so that if it does happen, it doesn't lead to a catastrophic loss scenario? Step 8. And this is where we're getting into the nitty gritty. This is the tax implications. and also thinking about asset location. The simple fact of the matter is that some forms of return stacking can be much more tax efficient than others. So as an example, let's again go back to this 100 100 stock bond fund we keep talking about. One way of creating this fund might be by buying the underlying stocks, Then buying US Treasury futures as an overlay on top. If that were all wrapped in an E T F, it would be on the more tax efficient side, especially because treasury futures get fairly preferential tax treatment compared to US Treasuries. If we were to reverse that implementation and instead, say, buy the treasuries and overlay it with S& P 500 futures, well, it wouldn't matter whether it's wrapped in an ETF or a mutual fund. That would be a fairly tax inefficient strategy. Especially since those S& P 500 futures typically receive far worse tax treatment than just passive buy and hold equities would usually. When in doubt, you should just reserve stacking for qualified accounts. This gets more nuanced when you start talking about stacks that are implemented with swaps versus futures, which have different tax treatments. Now, I'm not an accountant, and you should certainly talk with a tax expert, but when in doubt, always implement stacking in a qualified account.

if you are looking to stack with taxable money, make sure you take into account the tax considerations of how the stack is created. Last point in the checklist, number nine, consider line item risk. This is an important point for individuals to understand about themselves and but also for financial advisors and asset managers to consider about their clients. For an investor to get the benefits of any portfolio, they first have to be able to stick with that portfolio. Which not only means the performance of the portfolio as a whole, but they need to be able to stick with the volatility and relative performance of all the underlying line items. And that can change how you might consider implementing the same return stacking concept. So as an example, let's say you wanted to stack a 10% allocation to managed futures. There's at least three ways you can do this. 4 One way is to sell bonds and buy a fund that's going to give you stacked exposure to bonds and managed futures. The second way is to sell stocks and buy a fund that's going to give you stacked exposure to stocks and managed futures. The third way is to free up capital by selling stocks and bonds. Buying a capital efficient stock bond fund, and then using the freed up capital to buy a managed futures fund. If you were to x ray all three of those portfolios, they'll give you the same net exposure. All three approaches, effectively the same. But what's critically different is the performance of the line items. The performance of that stacked bond managed futures fund, for example, is going to be predominantly driven by managed futures. So if you replaced bonds to buy that exposure, the client is going to have a line item that is much more volatile than they're used to seeing. The fund that stacks stocks in managed futures, on the other hand, may be more internally well matched from a volatility perspective, but collectively will likely have much higher volatility than either stocks or managed futures alone. Similarly, that capital efficient stock bond fund might stand out in years like 2022 when stocks and bonds are moving in the same direction as well. But the isolated managed futures fund that you bought might stand out in a decade, like the 2000 tens were. It largely went sideways.

largely went sideways. Again, all of these approaches are largely identical at the aggregate portfolio level. But it's a question of which of the line item approaches is the client or investor more likely to stick with. Alright, from the top, a quick recap of the nine items in my checklist. 1. Figure out what I want to stack. 2. Make sure I measure the potential cost of implementing that stack so I understand my implied hurdle rate. 3. Determine how big a stack I actually want. Again, this is going to be heavily driven by what I'm actually trying to stack. 3. Figure out if what I want to stack exists in a pre stacked solution. 5. If it doesn't exist in a pre stacked solution, figure out how I'm going to free up the room in my portfolio using a capital efficient stock bond fund. 4. Make sure that in either approach I'm matching up my betas so I don't create a mismatch in the pre and post stacked portfolio profiles. Seven. Do one last quick check about risk. Really make sure I understand how what I'm stacking is going to behave relative to what I'm putting it on top of, and really think through the worst case scenarios. 5.Consider the tax implications and how I'm actually going to do my asset location. When in doubt, always try to focus on doing return stacking in 5 a qualified account. And 9. Particularly for those of us who are managing money on behalf of others, consider the line item risk. Even the exact same stacked concept can be implemented in multiple ways, which will have different line item experiences. Make sure we understand our clients. Make sure we understand the type of line item risk that they can tolerate.

Key Business Risk Metric I Use Most Financial Advisors Don't final [00:00:00]Corey Hoffstein:In this video I'm going to talk about something a little different. Most of the content I put out there, whether it's writing or video or even just social media on Twitter or LinkedIn, I spend most of my time talking about different investment concepts. The reality is I also run an asset management firm and there are things that I do behind the scenes, things that I think about that I don't often talk about. And one of those things is managing the risk of the asset management firm and there is one key metric that I have been using for years that I think is really important in thinking about managing the risk of my business and I think it's highly relevant not only to asset managers but also financial advisors. And so I wanted to make a video about So, what the metric is, how you can use it, and why I think it's useful. To set the stage and give a little bit of context, I want to go back a couple years to an article written by Meb Faber, who is the Chief Investment Officer and co founder of Cambria Funds. And the context of this article was the idea that financial advisors have far more exposure to markets than they probably think they do. And so, Meb listed a few ways in which advisors might actually be implicitly levered to the market. The first is just in their own personal accounts. If you're a financial advisor, it's very likely that you have exposure to stocks and bonds in your own personal account. And so you are subject to the fluctuations of stocks and bonds. The second is in your practice in the short term. Most advisors charge a fee on assets under management, and if those assets shrink because it's an equity bear market, or as we saw in 2022, a bond bear market, well, what that's ultimately going to imply is your short term cash flow is going to take a hit. Meb also pointed out that once you go from a short term bear market to a long term bear market, some of these problems can compound.

to change. They might not be as willing to contribute from savings. Some might even have to begin withdrawing assets to make up for the fact that they might have lost their job. And so an advisor's business becomes very cyclically sensitive to the behavior of the investments that their clients are in. The fourth thing that Meb pointed out was that Advisors who are part of a larger corporation. If the larger corporation has issues with cash flow, those advisors could end up out of a job. What I would add to this list is if you are not an advisor who works for a larger corporation, but you're a financial advisor who owns your own business. Well, the equity value of your business is typically measured as a multiple of revenue. And if you go into a prolonged bear market and the value of the assets that you're overseeing shrinks significantly, that also means the value of your firm 1 shrinks significantly. So at least on paper your illiquid net worth is taking a hit at the same time as your firm's cash flow and revenue. And so when we put all that together, it just simply means that financial advisors as well as asset managers have a huge amount of sensitivity, individually and at a firm level, to what's happening in financial markets. And so this brings us to the metric that I have used for years. I look at it almost every single month I recalculate this number to try to get a sense of Risk at my firm. And that, that metric is what I call the revenue weighted average portfolio. Alright, that's kind of a mouthful. What is the revenue weighted average portfolio? So every month what we do at my firm is we look at the mandates that we oversee. Whether they're in ETFs or mutual funds or separately managed accounts or model portfolios, whatever it is. We put them into a spreadsheet and they're all classified by exposure. And with that mandate is also going to be the revenue that we expect to generate from that mandate. I then create a portfolio where I assume each mandate is held in proportion to the amount of revenue that it will generate for the firm. It's a really simple example.

and the stock mandate is responsible for generating 60 percent of the firm revenue. And the bond mandate is responsible for generating 40 percent of the firm revenue. Well, then my revenue weighted average portfolio would be 60 percent stocks and 40 percent bonds. So this metric is really useful in trying to figure out, well, how volatile is my firm revenue going to be, and what are my key risk factors? As an example, a few years back, my firm won a 700 million mandate. The mandate was to implement an equity trend following strategy, and that mandate significantly skewed the revenue weighted average portfolio that my firm had. We now were significantly skewed towards equities, rather than being more well diversified, and significantly skewed towards the results of trend following as a strategy. So for me as a business manager, not only did I look at that and say, okay, I need to do my best to make sure that that client is happy, but I had to work with my business development team to say, how can we try to grow the other mandates that are less equity centric in our business so we can again try to diversify this pie? So how does this apply to financial advisors? So, for example, if you work primarily with retirees, your revenue weighted average portfolio is likely dominated by bonds. Volatility and interest rates, which can be driven by inflation volatility or unexpected changes in volatility. Conversely, if you do most of your work with growth clients, well then it's likely that your revenue weighted average portfolio is very equity centric. 2 And in that case, it would probably be prudent to plan for periods where your revenue retracts by 30 to 50 percent simply because of the fact that it's highly likely over the next 3, 5, 10 years that you go through a period of significant equity drawdowns. Now, most financial advisors don't actually run mandates. They run blended portfolios, and if that's you, don't worry. It's just as simple as looking at each of those different, maybe, model portfolios that you run, figuring out the amount of revenue that each model portfolio is going to contribute, and then averaging

together in proportion to the revenue that they are going to contribute. So if you generate, say, 50 percent of your revenue from clients who are in a 60 40 portfolio, and 50 percent of your revenue from clients who are in a 20 80 portfolio, well then your revenue weighted average portfolio is going to be a 40 So while I'll often argue that diversification is a really important concept for investors, I think the revenue weighted average portfolio makes it clear that diversification is a really valuable concept to asset managers and advisors as well, in terms of the stability that it can bring to their business. In my ideal world, the revenue weighted average portfolio would be well diversified. Really able to weather any market condition and therefore providing a stable revenue stream for the business. And I think this is where advisors and their clients are incredibly well aligned. The more certainty a client has in their financial plan, The more stable the cash flow should be for the financial advisor. So while you'll often hear me or us on this channel talk about alternative investment strategies and how you might be able to use return stacking as an investment concept to introduce them into your portfolio, it's not because alternatives are inherently good, it's because we believe that diversification is inherently good. Called the only free lunch on Wall Street, combining uncorrelated assets into a portfolio allows wealth to compound with greater consistency. So if you're a financial advisor, finding ways to introduce diversification into your client portfolios not only has the possibility of increasing the resiliency of their financial plan, but it also has the possibility of increasing the stability of your business. So if you've got any questions about this revenue weighted average portfolio idea, honestly, I wish I had a better name for it. It's such a mouthful and I've had to say it so many times, this video revenue weighted average portfolio. If you have any questions, please leave a comment below. I will do my best to get back to you. Or if you have any other questions about the concepts of diversification or return stacking, we're here to help.

is Return Stacking final [00:00:00]Corey Hoffstein:In this video, I want to talk about an investment concept that changed not just the way I think about managing my own portfolio, but also the mandates I manage on behalf of my clients. [00:00:11]Rodrigo Gordillo:We call this concept return stacking. If you haven't heard of it, you're in for a real treat. Let's get right into it. [00:00:17]Corey Hoffstein:So what is return stacking? Well, at its core, return stacking is the idea of layering one investment on top of another, giving you more than a dollar of exposure for every dollar invested. What's important about this concept is that it has the opportunity to help you unlock the benefits of diversification in a more efficient and effective manner. Now, as it turns out, this is not a novel approach. This is something institutions have been doing for decades. Using capital efficient derivatives like futures, swaps, and forwards, institutions were able to replace their core stock and bond exposure and allocate to alternative hedge fund strategies. So how does this work? Well, forwards, futures, and swaps give investors leverage. This means that the institutions were able to put out much less capital to get the exposure that they wanted, freeing up capital in their portfolios to invest elsewhere. [00:01:14]Rodrigo Gordillo:So a really quick example here would be say some endowment wanted to have a hundred percent exposure to the S& P 500. well, instead of taking a hundred percent of the cash and investing it in the S& P 500, they might be able to just put 10% aside as cash collateral. To buy a hundred percent exposure of an S& P 500 futures contract. Then with the remaining 90%, they can invest in, well, whatever they want. This is a really important concept because historically investors have had to make an either or decision. If you wanted to invest in alternative asset classes, you had to sell stock and bond exposure to make room in your portfolio for them.

concept of stacking returns on top of capital efficient exposures is more of a yes and approach. Allowing you to maintain your core stock and bond allocation while overlaying the alternatives on top. [00:02:03]Corey Hoffstein:Unfortunately, this approach has long been out of reach for many investors who are unable or unwilling to manage derivatives programs. Today, however, a wide variety of mutual funds and ETFs have come to market that pre package this concept into individual building blocks. Here at Return Stacked Portfolio Solutions, our mission is to provide the assembly instructions for those building blocks. 1 Now, there are a couple of potential benefits to consider with this concept. The first is by just adding more return streams to our portfolio, we have the opportunity to potentially enhance our long term portfolio returns. But if we're thoughtful about the return streams that we choose, not only may we have the opportunity to enhance long run returns, but we might actually also be able to reduce portfolio risk. Reducing volatility, reducing drawdowns, and enhancing safe withdrawal rates for those in retirement [00:03:02]Rodrigo Gordillo:... Now, we certainly can't guarantee that, but it doesn't mean that we can't try our best to be considerate of the type of diversification that we're ultimately trying to unlock. One of the big potential benefits of this approach is actually behavioral. Again, historically, to add alternatives to a portfolio, we had to sell stock and bond exposure to make room. This was really hard to do in decades like the 2010s. When diversifiers like commodities, gold, alternative investment strategies like managed futures really struggle. Not only did our money go nowhere during that decade, but we had an opportunity cost of missing out on what stocks and bonds did, especially if they were domestic stock and bonds. The return stacking concept allows us to layer those alternatives on top of stock and bond exposure, which means that we don't miss out on returns of stocks and bonds in a decade like the 2010s. And even if alternatives go sideways and provide middling returns, It's not that big a deal because you're stacking them on top.

[00:03:55]Corey Hoffstein:. One of the first questions we always get when talking about return stacking is, well, if you're stacking returns, aren't you also stacking risk? And I suspect a lot of this notion comes from , the fact that concentrated leverage is pretty much at the center of every major Wall Street implosion over the last hundred years. So we just want to make one thing really clear. When we talk about return stacking, we think the benefits are there if we're thoughtful about those asset classes and exposures that we're stacking on top. What we really want to make sure is that the things we pick to add on top of our portfolio are designed to zig when our underlying portfolio is going to zag. At Return Stacked Portfolio Solutions, we offer a number of services and products to help investors get started on their return stacking journey. We offer mutual funds and ETFs that are the building blocks that can be used to implement return stacking. For financial advisors, we also offer model portfolios. These are turnkey portfolio solutions that are pre designed to incorporate return stacking concepts and come in a variety of risk levels that can be custom tailored to different client outcomes and objectives. Now, these can be used as off the 2 shelf solutions, or they can just be used as inspiration on your own journey of trying to understand how to implement return stacking. Finally, we're always happy to consult with advisors and institutions about how return stacking can be implemented in their portfolios. [00:05:23]Rodrigo Gordillo:What's important here is that return stacking is not just another buzzword. This is a strategic approach that has been used by institutions for decades. And we think this concept has the opportunity to significantly enhance outcomes for investors truly harnessing the power of return. Stacking means unlocking the benefits of diversification without sacrificing your core stock and bond exposure.

Sacrifice Return stacking strives to unlock the benefits of diversification, helping investors achieve their goals with greater certainty. The Math is Clear... It is said that the only free lunch in investing is diversification.

At Return Stacked® Portfolio Solutions, we are developing the research, product design, and portfolio construction that unlocks this opportunity for everyone. For illustrative purposes only. Making Room in a Portfolio Assume you held a 50% stock / 50% bond portfolio. You could replace your holdings with a fund that provides the same exposure with 1.5x leverage (a “75/75” fund). By allocating 2/3 rds of your portfolio to such a fund, you create a capital efficient implementation that frees up 1/3 rd of the portfolio for a variety of potential uses. For example, similar to PIMCO’s StocksPLUS program, the available capital could be allocated to low-duration, high quality bonds. It might also be allocated to alternative assets and strategies that have the potential to introduce beneficial diversification to the portfolio. You could also choose to leave some, or all, of it in cash to help better manage cash-flow needs (e.g. withdrawals or capital calls) without sacrificing core stock and bond exposure. Packaging portable alpha into a fund structure can allow investors to free up room in their portfolio Explicitly Stacking Alternatives Funds implementing return stacking may combine a variety of betas (e.g., stocks and bonds), non-traditional betas (e.g., commodities), and alternative investment strategies in a variety of leverage targets to provide capital efficient exposure for investors.

9:14 AMWhat is Return Stacking? - Return Stacked® Portfolio Solutions Page 4 of 8https://returnstacked.com/what-is-return-stacking/ wanted to stack the alternative strategy on top of your existing portfolio, you could simply sell some of your bonds and buy the fund. Why Return Stacking? Pursuing Diversification without Sacrifice Investors can introduce diversifying assets and strategies without sacrificing exposure to their traditional asset allocation. Opportunity for Enhanced Returns By introducing additional sources of return, Return Stacking creates the potential for outperformance, which may be particularly attractive in an environment where expected returns for traditional assets may be muted. Potential to Improve Diversification By thoughtfully introducing differentiated return streams, investors may gain a diversification advantage with the potential to reduce portfolio volatility and drawdowns. Managing Investor (Mis- )Behavior Alternative investments can be difficult to stick with, particularly when they underperform traditional assets for years on end (often with higher costs, less tax efficiency, and less transparency). Historically, to make room for alternatives in your portfolio, you would have to sell core stock and bond exposure. The choice to add alternatives is also a choice to subtract stocks and bonds. This has the potential of creating meaningful underperformance during strong bull markets. With return stacking, you have the potential to maintain your core stock and bond exposure, reducing tracking error to your benchmark. In the figure below, we assume an investor has a 60% S&P 500 / 40% Bloomberg Core US Bond benchmark. In the first case, they allocate 33% of their portfolio to managed futures by selling stocks and bonds equally. In the second case, they stack the returns on top.
