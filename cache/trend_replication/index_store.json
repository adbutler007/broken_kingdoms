can do a little bit of table setting for us. Gerald Rushton  02:04 So my name is Gerald Rushton. I started my career at Lehman Brothers working in subprime mortgages. And you guys may have heard, that ended pretty badly for everybody. So at that point, I needed to find a new career, I’d studied computer science, pretty quiet guy. So I found out about systematic investing. I’ve been doing that ever since. So at Macquarie, which is a Australian investment bank, I work as part of the QA s structuring team. So quantitative investment strategies. And what we do is we research, design and implement systematic trading strategies across all asset classes. What does that mean? Well, like how the s&p 500 has a weighting scheme and rules to determine the level, the rule being market cap weighted, we build indices that have maybe different weighting schemes and different analyzers, trying to implement things like trend carrying value across different asset classes. And then cons can access those products. In a way you can access any index product and swap an option, a fund an ETF, you name it, you can get as exotic and funky as you like, we can do it. Corey Hoffstein  03:13 So I’m going to come out of the gate swinging a little bit here, maybe address the elephant in the room, which is that bank cue is desks have historically had a bit of a mixed reputation when it comes to launching systematic strategies. There’s a number of cases where you sort of get that classic up into the right index goes live, and then it flatlines. Why do you think this is historically been the case? And do you think that QA s desks have evolved over time to address this problem? Gerald Rushton  03:25 Definitely come out swinging there. So you’re referring to the hockey stick profile. As you said, the backtest looks amazing, then you can pinpoint the date and it’s live, because then it starts trickling down. And I think there were a lot of examples of that in the past 10 years or so ago.

nowadays, I don’t really think that’s the case. I think there’s a couple of things to say about that. One, everyone has been guilty of a bit of back test overfitting the past, when you’re a bit younger, bit naive, your expectations are not particularly grounded, then you want to make some mistakes. I think one of the disadvantages we have secure is businesses that we’re very transparent. You can see the performance of every strategy that we launch. And so of course, it’s easy to find a few industries that have the hockey stick, and one of them and make a few checks, have I’d say the industry has really evolved the last decade or so. So as way of background, the big kind of boom in queue is desks, happened after the publication of what’s known as the three professors report by an Desmond Schaffer, which was basically commissioned by naugus Bank, the sovereign wealth fund of Norway to basically ask the question, what happened the GFC we thought we were diversified, but we still lost a ton of money. And they basically said, Well, you’re not really meant Following the literature and the developments we’ve had in finance. And there are other factors that were missing things like trend carry value. So that point, a lot of the Nordic pension schemes started looking at these types of strategies, and looking to banks to implement them. And maybe 10 years ago, there was a bit of a rush to fill out the so called risk premium matrix, maybe a little bit of equity quality tourism, where people apply the classic decile longshot approach to the macro asset classes where it’s a little bit less of a valid approach, I’d say. But nowadays, we have plenty of very serious people in the business people publishing in top academic journals. And we have a lot more experience. I would also say the clients are a lot more sophisticated. There’s a lot of tough questions, they want to see all the rigorous analysis about parameter sensitivity, how you’ve come up with these models. So there’s definitely been a big evolution as a whole industry is doing a lot better now than it was 1015 years ago.

Corey Hoffstein  03:25 Part of the problem with the last generation of QIS indices was maybe an over reliance on academic work, or an attempt at directly porting equity quant strategies. I love that phrase you used maybe equity quite tourism was going on. And you can contrast that to where new ideas are coming from today. Gerald Rushton  03:25 I think back then there was maybe a view that you couldn’t deviate from the literature that what was written in an academic paper was almost some kind of god given truth. And the only changes you could make were to restrict the universe to the tradable instruments, for example, and maybe add some transaction costs. So I think trend following was an interesting case there were prior to the publication time series momentum by muskets and all. There was a bit of skepticism about despite the fact that the CTA industry have been implementing trend for decades very successfully. Nowadays, people are much more open to ideas that not come from the academic literature. The porting thing is definitely a bugbear of mine as a macro guy. And here we’re talking about the idea that you need to be essentially dollar neutral, you need to rank things and go long, the top X short the bottom y. And in the macro space, you we have fewer instruments that are tradable, we potentially have higher correlations and things like rates. And also we have very wildly different volatilities, like if you think about commodities, like the vol, nat gas and the whole of gold are really not the same. So in a long, short decile type strategy. If you’re long, like nat gas, you’ve got a nat gas strategy unless you’re a little bit smarter about risk taking. And so like how trend was kind of validated by literature has become a staple of QIS desks, other hedge fund like strategies are now the staple of QIS desks as well.

is where our edge comes from. There are a lot of strategies that it’s just not practical to run. Without that tech and trading capability like something like commodities, volatility carry a strategy, where being high touch selling options every day, multiple different strikes, delta hedging multiple times per day, across a whole range of commodities, it’s a pain, you need a lot of traders, you need a lot of data, you have models to do that. So what a lot of our clients faces, not a limitation in terms of their kind of intelligence or understanding what they want to do is just purely operations. And so being within a bank trading, that’s our bread and butter, that’s very easy for us to do. And a lot of these strategies, significant edge does come from in high touch. They’re also slightly more boring reasons why we have some edge, which is that there’s something called Rob Carver talks about in his books, you can’t run some strategies in small size, because of the contract size, it’s the size of the JGB contract is like a million dollars. So you’re not going to get to kind of very refined position taking unless you have very large notional. Also data. We spend millions of dollars a year on data, we spend millions of dollars a year on our tech team. It’s all very expensive to run systematic strategies. Well, the other advantage I think we have is that because we’re working very closely with the smart clients, we’re essentially almost crowdsourcing some ideas from them and refining ideas. Whereas in a hedge fund type setup, you might be working with a much smaller group of individuals. And so that kind of questioning and probing that we get from clients helps us improve the models. Corey Hoffstein  03:25 In our pre call you mentioned that over 50% of the strategies you trade on behalf of clients are actually customized. Can you talk maybe to the sorts the strategies clients are looking for today and some of the ways in which you’re able to customize them.

I don’t have any problem with CTAs. What I have a problem with is maybe the way we’ve been pitching trend. As an industry. As you’re saying the pitches are so good. It’s pretty high. Sharpe, positive skewness does well, in an equity crisis does well and innovation crisis, what’s not to like? I mean, it’ll even tuck you in bed with a bedtime story and give you a glass of milk. It really is the ultimate strategy. I think the issue there is a lot of that pitch is not true. If you’ve not been very thoughtful about how you’ve built the trend following strategy, and particularly started looking at the evidence. We’re pitching trend as an industry, including my past sell as a crisis hedge. But what happened to q4 2018? Well, trend following was down what happened in the acute period and stress in the COVID. Era? Well trend following Stan. So I was quite sure that when we came up the idea of crisis alpha that it was supposed to be a positive alpha, not a negative alpha. So we’ve got a bit of a problem here. And that has led to a lot of disappointment from investors and a lot of mockery in the media. As an aside. And this is not obviously investment advice. If you do see an article in the FT saying quants, bamboozled by markets, that I’m pretty certain it’s got 100% hit rate in terms of the time to get max long trend following, someone should write a research paper about that. So you can build trend to get very different payoffs are the same kind of rules. People nowadays have been talking about faster trend following and more long term trend following. And those strategies have very different payoffs. And you need to understand the kinds of goals when you’re pitching them trend. What are they really looking for what is even a crisis mean? Some people really do care about a really bad week. Some people care about really bad here, and we need to make sure that the clients expectations are met by the transplant program we have provided to them.

of the other issues that I have is the famous convexity chart. So everyone’s seen it use plot quality returns of s&p 500 versus quality returns of the CTA benchmark, choose your favorite. I like the new hedge one. And you see this lovely strap like profile. And you say hey, and also remember the phone shape paper. The risk in hedge fund strategies trend is like a look at straddle QED it’s long vol it’s a hedge. The issue is if you look at the data over the past 20 years, it’s just not true. So yes, you plot the quarterly returns of s&p versus the new edge index, you do get a straddle this is not a robust result. You remove a single point you remove q4 2008. The whole story disappears. It’s no longer convex when you’re looking at the CTA industry as a whole. Of course, there will be people who still are convex. And I bet those guys are doing shorter term trend following in our deck we have a chart which really kind of blows people’s minds when they see it, which is putting the skewness versus Sharpe ratio of course as a trend following so one day trend following or let’s say one year trend, following up What you see if you do that exercise is also a bit alarming is trend becomes negatively skewed. When you start looking at trends over six months, it’s got a great Sharpe ratio. But it’s no longer this positively skewed convex hedge that we’ve been pitching as an industry. The other issue I have with the way as an industry have been pitching trend is really in our explanation of it, like why does it work? So there’s a lot of papers about their behavioral aspects, you know, the under reaction, and then subsequent overreaction to news, the institutional lags that can exist in absorbing that news, creating that effect, overcrowding, hurting all these kind of things? And then there’s some truth to that. But I think what we’re not talking about is they’re also rational reasons why trend following could exist. Think about Eurodollar futures are now safer futures.

are really just tracking the policy rate of the Fed. And what is the Fed doing? Well, it’s reacting to the business cycle, and inflation. And those are very cyclical. If you check the quarterly changes in CPI, it looks like a random walk until you condition it on the previous change. And so if the last quarter CPI rose, the next quarter, there’s an 80% probability that it rose like there are trends in the economic cycle, and the Fed is reacting to those trends. Now, maybe there’s a question, why do they not react faster? Well, if you read Ben Bernanke is essay on Central Bank, gradualism, you’ll understand that there’s a reason why central banks are cautious and act gradually. And it’s basically long and variable lags. So I think as an industry, we just need to do a better job of communicating why trend following is a great strategy is having a portfolio, but also make sure that we’re giving people the right type of trend following for the objectives. And I should probably stop now before getting any more trouble. Corey Hoffstein  16:54 Well, one of the things you mentioned there was the ability to customize the payoff profile of trend following and one of the things we often see trend following strategies that are particularly pitched as being crisis Alpha trend strategies, as they impose different limits to explicitly trying to create negative betas to equities. So for example, you might see them impose constraints that they can never be long equity index futures, or that they could never be short bonds, given the desire to create a payoff profile that is convex during periods of equity crises. Do you see these sorts of constraints as ultimately being useful? Gerald Rushton  17:29 I think it’s a really good idea. The issue is it’s fraught with danger. Estimating betas is hard. Like we know that. How are you going to define your covariance matrix? Are you going to use shrinkage?

our team finds 234 papers and better ways to do it. Now, it’s about intraday data. It’s about using machine learning. So it’s hard thing to do. And one of the issues with this is that we know that these betas can change. And the problem with using it in a trend following program, in my opinion, that’s supposed to be a hedge is that the time these betas change is a crisis period. It’s kind of changing at the exact time, you need to view super accurate. So I think it’s a good idea. But if you’re not doing well, it’s going to be potentially backfire. And I think that’s quite a bad situation to be in with a client, right? It’s different, in my opinion, that if your trend following estimation of beats goes wrong, when you take a big loss, that’s a very bad outcome. Whereas if you were trying to say just be to hedge your portfolio, or something like FX carry, which is highly procyclical, and it goes wrong, you’re probably still going to significantly reduce the drawdown, and the clients probably going to be quite happy. So I think it’s so great area of research and good idea, but if it’s done poorly, not so great, I think trend, you should let the data speak for itself. It’s very rare that we have a true exogenous shock, even COVID. We knew about it really three months before the market. So I think it’s better to just focused on making sure your implementation is robust in terms of having the right kind of signals the right kind of rebalancing rules, the right overall risk taking than trying to be a little bit too swamped. Corey Hoffstein  19:24 I think, for most institutions, and perhaps individuals, the Holy Grail is finding a strategy that can provide that convex hedge that we’re looking for, and then pairing it with a strategy that can carry positively and offset the bleed of the hedge.

the same time the hedge kicks in ultimately negating any benefit from the hedge. Curious what sort of strategies you think might fit in this bucket. Corey Hoffstein  19:50 This is the million dollar question. Right now. We’re working with clients in every single region on this question. Broadly speaking, obviously, people can buy puts But that’s very, very expensive. So people are turning to statistical hedges and shorter term trend following syscall hedge. There are other ones, like rates Vega intraday trend following. There’s a whole bunch of ideas out there that have shown good returns in crisis periods. The issue with this is, with the exception of, say, rates vaguer, they’re going to probably carry it negatively. And that makes it hard to live with. What I’ve seen in my career so far is people put these hedges on, it bleeds for one or two years, and then they decide to take it off, or their managers tell them to take it off, or they’re bored, or it might be. And obviously, the moment they do that, it works really well. And it’s a crisis. And that’s just the way life is. So we as quants probably think of ourselves as hyper rational beings that would never ever do such a thing like that. But that’s not really the world we live in. So what we’ve been trying to do, and others is to pair these negative carried strategies and suggested with positive carry strategies. And we find that commodities markets are really an interesting place to be looking for these sources of returns. Because things like aunties carry, and congestion, they have pretty good performance through time. And the times that these strategies underperform don’t always coincide with equity beater, basically. So you’re not likely to blow up at the same time. And so that’s the kind of space we’ve been looking at. Obviously, the story doesn’t end there, you then need to think about well have i size these two legs? And we’ve done a lot of work on that.

the strategies, commodities, I think is the best place to be looking. Corey Hoffstein  21:43 Let’s dive into some of those strategies. And maybe let’s start with commodity carry. Can you provide an overview, what is commodity carry? Why you think it fits the bill have this sort of positive carry strategy that maybe is less correlated with equities? And then I hate doing multi part questions. Here we go is a multi part question. I would love to know from your perspective, what the major design levers are, that can influence the return profile of this sort of strategy, Corey Hoffstein  22:10 quantities carry. It’s not a strategy that’s particularly well covered in the literature. And it’s basically a curve strategy. And so the simplest implementation would be something we would call F three versus F zero carry. And for example, you’d be short, the August WTI, contract, and long the November WTI contract. And you do this across the liquid set of commodities that you have, what is the point of doing this is that commodities curves are driven by basically storage costs, which gives these past trades long and short contracts, different role yields that you’re trying to capture. So it’s not really about roll up the curve or carry between commodities, like you might see in FX, it’s really the story of role yields. Now, even the simplest implementation of commodities carry on, say, a beacom. Universe, it’s got a pretty high Sharpe ratio. So post cost, you’re looking at something well north of one as a Sharpe ratio, and pretty consistent returns through time. So that makes it very, very attractive as a funding leg for these kind of negative carry strategies that we were mentioning earlier. And it is a risk premium strategy. So it’s not free money, it’s an arbitrage. But those risks are typically commodity specific shocks, typically to the upside. So a drought in agricultural markets, stocks can be bad for commodities carry strategy, or the invasion of Ukraine in terms of oil prices spiking.

most often than not, these risks don’t coincide with the big macro shops. And in fact, it’s actually the opposite. Typically, in a big macro shock, the front end of the commodities curve, particularly oil sells off very rapidly giving these strategies, a little bit of an extra kick in those crisis periods. So also make them pretty attractive. Now, that was pretty much the most simple implementation could describe the F three versus F zero. In terms of the levers? Well, obviously, the first question is, what contracts am I going to select? So in commodities, we have pretty liquid curves. So unlike equities, where you can only trade the front month apartment during the roll period, you’ve got good liquidity, two or three years out in most commodities. So we’re on the curve tool to be taking longer curve spreads. So not just three months part is going to give you more follow potential return, but it’s a little bit riskier. Maybe you want to be dynamic, why stick to F three, f zero and f six F zero? Maybe you could try and identify the best places to be on the curve dynamically. So once you’ve done that, you need to think about sizing. So do I want to be notional neutral? Do I want to be locked neutral or do I want to use some risk based measure? Maybe I want to be voltage drop, maybe on a bar for the race literature, and do something really funky like a PCA weighted exposure. That’d be pretty cool. And so now you’ve got your, what we would call a mono alpha. So you’ve got your dynamic risk weighted single commodity curve strategy, well, how do I make a portfolio of this? What’s my objective, if I want to do massive size, then I’m probably gonna go be calm or GSCI weighted, because that’s where the liquidity is becoming GSCI indices, that weights are basically determined by liquidity in production. But if you’re less concerned about that, maybe you could think of a better portfolio construction technique.

value added of a cure structure is that we understand what these levers are. And we can help explain them to you and make sure you’re getting the right implementation for your portfolio. Corey Hoffstein  25:57 I would imagine that one of the other potential benefits being at Macquarie in particular, is that you are a commodity Bank, which would mean compared to many folks on the buy side, or perhaps even in comparison to many other banks. On the sell side, you have access to a larger universe of commodities. Can you provide some examples of maybe these non benchmark commodities that you might have access to and talk a little bit about the impact of including them within trend or carry strategies. Corey Hoffstein  26:23 So as well as background of the listeners, when we refer to the benchmark commodities, we’re referring to the commodities inside the beat calm and the s&p GSCI universe, these are the economists you know, love Brent, WTI, gold, copper, wheat, etc. The non benchmark quantities are basically all that other commodity futures that didn’t make the cut, and they’re not particularly exotic. Like you’ve got things, orange juice futures, that obviously made by famous biofilm Trading Places, you have UK, natural gas, European natural gas, you have London cocoa has a whole range. And there’s a good number of liquid instruments that you can trade systematically. There’s also the onshore China commodities, these are still they’re not strange things. But maybe the contracts a bit more exotic to us, for example, there are egg futures, or glass futures or plastic futures, but there’s commodities. It’s just the real world things that we use to build stuff. Obviously, the astute listener will be thinking, well, that lists liquid that must be really expensive to trade. And luckily, that’s not true, they are a little bit more expensive. There are a few exceptions that are a lot more expensive. And as I think some of your previous guests have hinted at getting access to onshore China, commodities is not easy with offshore money, but it can be done.

you take the relatively low cost liquid seven non benchmark commodities that are outside of China, and apply trend following for example, one of the things you’re gonna see is you’re gonna have almost two and a half times the Sharpe ratio post cost compared to what you’d see in a benchmark universe. So just very standard trend following windows, you have between one and 12 months 2.5 times the Sharpe ratio in last 15 years. So that’s pretty cool. We’d like to we’d like higher Sharpe issues. The question is, what’s going on there? Why is that the case? Is that just some kind of historical fluke? Or is there a reason for that? And the reason isn’t necessarily what I think most people think we’re using the same model. So it’s not like we’ve got a better model. And if you looked at the data, it’s not really the case that these commodities are trending more than the benchmark commodities, maybe with the exception of natural gas last two years. And you’re really what is happening is the correlation between the individual trend strategies is just much much lower. So okay, well, that’s why but high Sharpe ratio. But why is the correlation lower? Is that a fluke? And again, there’s a fundamental explanation that basically, the benchmark commodities are part of the asset allocation toolkit that most kinds of asset owners have, and they are subject to flows from pension funds, sovereign wealth, funds, etc. And so they’re more financialized. And there’s been a ton of papers over the last 15 years or so about this topic. And, you know, essentially, there’s much high correlation between professional commodities. And while the non benchmark commodities remain outside of there, it’s not likely that the pairwise correlation will increase. The trends in say orange juice futures are being driven by the fundamentals of orange juice, you’re getting a more kind of like idiosyncratic trend than, let’s say like commodity betta trend, curb carry. Unfortunately, the curve is not quite as liquid.

you’re going to struggle a bit there, but sort of a trend following super useful instruments, as I know none of your guests have piloted before. Corey Hoffstein  29:54 One of the things we saw in the early 2000s to sort of around 2000 10 was that there was a large increase in the demand for commodity strategies, you can just commodity beta. And one of the strategies that became popular was this idea of commodity congestion. And we’re starting to see that again, as commodity strategies ramp up in popularity. I’m starting to hear a lot more people talk about commodity congestion strategies. Can you talk us through what is a commodity congestion strategy, and maybe once again, talk about sort of the major design levers that can influence the return profile. 30:29 So you’re referring to a strategy known as the gstr roll, which is a super popular contest congestion strategy, it’s been around for 25 years or so. And the basic idea is that all we had any congestion strategy is that you know, of an event that is going to cause a lot of trading, I don’t need something like NFP where obviously we’re not trading, but you know, the trading, that’s going to happen. So how do you know this? Well, you go to the s&p GSCI website, you download the index rules of the index. And you can see what days it pulls its positions. And so if you want to know that there’s a lot of assets following that particular index, then of course, you could position around that and essentially provide liquidity during the roll period, and earn a pretty decent return. Now, these strategies are obviously not as well known in the academic literature and more kind of practitioner strategies. But as you’re saying, they’ve been around for a long time. And they exist across all asset classes. So examples in FX could be around the 4pm, WR fix in rates, you could think about bond auctions, you could think about the duration extension at the end of the month, and an equities we obviously have things like stocks entering exes in the indices and other effects.

it comes to congestion, clearly, then you need to know is really the intricacies of the market? Who are the players? What are they doing? Are they still behaving in the way you expect? So people don’t necessarily invest in just the front month of the quantities universe. Now, there are such things as deferred indices, where you might go a bit further down the curve. So in terms of the Levers, it’s obviously very strategy specific. But really, the three things are kind of adjusting are, how early to enter how late to exit? And how do you kind of risk manage that portfolio of congestion strategies to make sure you’re not taking on other unwanted risks. And the other thing is you need to keep consistently innovating. So the original GSCI strategy, a simplest implementation, in the pitch mentioned, Sharpe ratio too easy. Nowadays, that strategies a lot weaker, but there are ideas you can use to make strategy dynamic, and those dynamic implementations still performing really well. Corey Hoffstein  32:52 So we could probably argue that commodity carry is more of a risk premium. But congestion strategies are much more of a behavioral phenomenon and can probably, therefore, more easily be arbitrage away. How do you make sure that congestion doesn’t get congested? Corey Hoffstein  33:09 Absolutely, it is behavioral, it is an anomaly and it can be arbitrage away. I think the issue with congestion or the master congestion versus other arbitrage does is that the behavior is dictated by the index rules. If you are hedging an index exposure for a client, if you don’t follow the next rules, you’re taking a basis risk. And that’s not necessarily everyone’s job. So you need to keep track of the index footprint, try and measure what the flows are into the common GSCI. And the ways you can do this, you need to think about measuring congestion returns to try and find out if it is being traded or not. There are ways you can track this and ways you can think about where to play congestion. So yes, congestion itself is congested.

is congested. Well, maybe I could have a strategy around that. As I mentioned, we’ve seen a lot of consistency across the dynamic implementations. And they’ve generally done a pretty good job of kind of outperforming the more simple static ones. And yet, you just have to keep innovating both in commodities, and other asset classes. A good example is, as I mentioned, the FX WR fix. So the idea here is that at 4pm, at the end of the month, people adjust the FX hedges like so global investors. And so people used to try and catch that Premier, just really using quite slow trading rules, your trade 4pm The day before, exit at the end of the month. Well, that strategy infant in that way has deteriorated significantly in the last decade or so. But maybe you could be a bit faster. Maybe you could trade just a few hours before the 4pm Fix. That’s obviously if you do that, it’s gonna prevent you taking too much like general macro risk, which will obviously did a lot of last few years in terms of data releases and the Feds features. So yeah, Innovation is key in contrast Corey Hoffstein  35:00 To taken somewhat to an absurd limit, a congestion strategy gets implemented further away from an index role, in many ways just becomes a carry strategy. Can you discuss maybe how these two strategies interact and how we should think about allocating to them so as to avoid doubling up on the same risks? Corey Hoffstein  35:19 Yeah, it’s definitely a fair point. So in commodities, both of those strategies are what we’d call short spread strategies. So there is going to naturally be some correlation. I think the key thing is just first to be aware that this is what you’re doing. The issue is, when you start using dynamic presentations, it becomes quite a tricky exercise to think about that. And so I think just awareness of the problem is key. And making sure like in the worst case scenario of them both having exactly the same positions, that you’re not taking on too much risk, in terms of the other issue about doing congestion strategies

strategies earlier and earlier. And that can be carried trade. I think, as long as you’re measuring how much of your congestion returns has come from carry, and then you still got that congestion spirit of your strategy, still probably okay. And those returns can be quite different for different countries as well. It’s about awareness and just keeping track of what is going on. And making sure you’re not doubling up in the wrong times. Corey Hoffstein  36:22 So one of the strategies that you mentioned earlier, though, didn’t explicitly mention here. But something that’s top of mind for you is commodity volatility carry, I’d love to dive a little bit into that strategy. And maybe start with a comparison into how it’s similar or different than equity volatility carry. Corey Hoffstein  36:41 At, it’s cool, it’s the same, you are selling options at a high implied volatility that is higher than the subsequent realized volatility. And you’re capturing that spread by selling an option structure like a straddle and then delta hedging that package. Also, the return profile is similar in each day, you’re probably earning a little bit. And then in a period of stress, when realized bowl jumps, you’re probably going to take a pretty big loss. So in that way, they’re extremely similar. The differences come in that the tails don’t necessarily overlap. Like a lot of people argue that vault carries essentially like an insurance product to insure in the market, and how insurance businesses work or they diversify, the things are ensuring and so quantities for carry, there’s at least eight 910, very liquid commodities, you can do this on, and then you could theoretically do it in the full universe, but smaller size, so up to 24. So you’re getting a lot of different tail exposure, it’s still earning that kind of VRP, the volatility risk premia. Clearly, in a big crisis period, like the GFC COVID, there is going to be some overlap in the tails, you need to be aware of that.

also need to be aware that each market has its own subtleties in terms of the players in that market and where they are active, it is not necessarily the case that the front of the curve is the best place to be in. And so yeah, commodities can be pretty weird, it’s best to go in there with a little bit of fundamental knowledge, and make sure you’re not making any terrible errors. Corey Hoffstein  38:17 So on that topic of fundamental knowledge, despite the Q is name, I know that you and your team lean heavily on your colleagues who can provide a lot of fundamental insights into these different markets. So maybe you could provide some examples of how those fundamental insights make their way into the quantitative strategy design. Corey Hoffstein  38:36 So we’re definitely not in a pure math cap. In a way you’re just kind of applying math to data and hoping for a good outcome. We think it is important to try and understand the fundamentals of the market, not just in commodities, but elsewhere, and trying to incorporate those into the strategy design. Now, when I’m talking about fundamentals, I’m not talking about the view from the research team, about what will happen to oil in the next couple of months. And talking about the market structure, things like seasonality, information from the trading desk about who are the different players in different parts of the curve. Like in rates, we have the concept of the market segmentation hypothesis, and quantities, producers, consumers and speculators are active in different parts and you should be aware of this. It’s really kind of like a form of craftsmanship Alpha. As you mentioned, seasonality is a pretty big part of the commodities complex. And what we mean by seasonality is that there are some commodities which have very distinct seasons. So natural gas in the winter behaves completely different to natural gas in the summer, as a lot of commodity strategies are curve based, taking a cross seasonal spread, can you expose you to a risk that you potentially not aware of? And while those risks can be measured, and may have historically been compensated uted we may also be suffering from a piece of property.

natural gas is a good example there were. Historically it looked like taking winter summer spreads was a positive risk premia. But then in winter 2018, we saw that that may not actually be the case. So it’s just being aware of what you’re doing on this market, it’s not quite as simple as other markets might be in terms of the market structure. Corey Hoffstein  40:27 I think for those of us coming from an equity quant background, we can be caught off guard as to how important that seasonality element is, particularly in commodity strategies. You mentioned that gas, I love to just think of the coffee example where you go along the far dated coffee contract and short up front dated contract, you could be talking about totally different harvests, they are truly very different deliverables. That’s maybe hoping you could talk a little bit more about how considerations for seasonality find their way into these different commodity strategies, how’s it work into carry or congestion or volatility carry? Corey Hoffstein  41:02 We did touch on this a little bit in the previous answer. And really, the adjustments can be pretty simple. You don’t have to do too crazy. So when we’re talking about carry, maybe you just want to adjust the roll schedule. So you’re doing let’s say, the F three F series strategy I described earlier. But you know, when you get to a cross seasonal spread, you just adjust the roll schedule. So if you’re taking a long day to contract, and you’re no longer taking to that winter, summer spread in voluntary, it can be just as simple as not selling options in those periods or when it comes to agricultural commodities. As you say, something like coffee, you may be looking at completely different harvests. And the risk and those types of strategies comes at harvest time, terrible weather, just as you’re about to harvest a coffee or wheat or corn or whatever, can result in extremely large moves. But just for a single contract, right? So we don’t have to be too complex with these adjustments.

But to avoid that, you don’t have to be too sophisticated. Corey Hoffstein  42:08 Taking a quick turn off the commodity topic here in our pre call you mentioned that FX carry was starting to make a comeback after being largely left for dead post GFC. What do you think we learned from the crisis and why is now a good time to be considering the strategy. 42:27 FX Carry is really having an incredible couple of years last few years, since central banks have started hiking, there is essentially just more carry to harvest. So in terms of what we learned coming back full circle to what I’ve seen about the evolution of Qs desks, effects carry is one of the oldest Qs strategies out there, there are implementations from 20 years or so ago. But the construction there was really incredibly naive, you’d have a G 10 universe, you would rank them from one to $10 billion dollar good long, top three short the bottom three equal notional, and then you would rebalance once a month or maybe even once a quarter. And so those strategies actually did pretty well, from the period of say 2002. To those three ups, the GFC were essentially the equity beta of FX carrier was exposed. There’s also been a ton of academic literature about this and the explanations being of why this person exists. I think it’s like shocks to consumption growth, liquidity premia, etc. And so you have something which turns out to be very, pretty simple. And post GFC. There wasn’t much carried to capture, so you had absolutely no upside, pretty much, and then all the downside of equities. And obviously, most clients have got enough equity beta in their portfolio already. So definitely left for dead. There are other issues, that kind of portfolio construction, which is your often hide carry currencies, particularly when you look at the EM space, are having a crisis of their own.

can just have your whole strategy being driven by a single currency, which is really not great. So the latest strategies in the space are really trying to think about this. So making sure the marginal contribution to rest of any one particular currency is not too high, making sure that you have adjusted the weights to be neutral to equity market beta to make the strategy really deliver, like let’s say the pure alpha of efforts carry without any additional equity meter. And by doing that, you can make the strategy a lot more attractive to clients because it gives them something a little bit different compared to those much more simple implementations Corey Hoffstein  44:53 Ok Gerald, we’ve come to the end of the episode here and I want to ask you the same question I’ve been asking everyone this season. which is about the tarot card, they chose to inform the design of the cover of their episode. And you chose death, which I thought was an interesting choice. And I was wondering what was it about the imagery, or perhaps the cards meeting that spoke to you either personally or professionally, 45:18 My colleagues initially suggested I gave for the tower, because I’m really tall. And then that do you want us to would have been a better approach because I like to be thorough in my research, and I really fell into a deep, deep black hole of research into tarot, haven’t known nothing about before, I would have saved a lot of time, but listen to my colleagues. And that’s the case with Taro. And also for quantum research, I’d say, I certainly know that she’s death really, for three reasons. One, it is the most misunderstood card in tarot, it doesn’t really mean you’re going to die. And that resonated with me because I think cuantas basically the most misunderstood strategy, or at least investment style out there. And as we’re doing now, I spend a lot of my time trying to demystify quant investing, and get people comfortable with that, because I just think everyone should be doing it. So that was the first reason.

from an old way into a new way. And as I mentioned, again, that kind of resonates with me in terms of trying to get people away from that, like very old school 1960s 1970s. Were investing. The idea that there’s nothing predictable out there, that everything’s a random walk, if you will, not being aware of the other kind of risk premia out there that they can use to enhance their portfolio. And also thinking in ways that not supported by the evidence, we try to be as quant super data driven, and make decisions based on data and not emotion. So that also resonated with me.

1 ReSolve Riffs on How to Replicate Trend Following Managed Futures  Rodrigo: 00:48 All right. Hello, everybody. Happy Friday.  Mike: 00:55 Mid-afternoon, happens to fall after Thursday. That’s right.  Rodrigo: 00:58 And people get to see their favorite people two weeks in a row. No guests for the second time in a row. That sounds like we’ve never done that before.  Adam :01:00:10 There’s a lot of ReSolve team presence the last few weeks.  Mike: 01:00:14 We’ve got something that’s so hot off the press, it might even burn your fingers a little bit.  Rodrigo: 01:00:17 Like, literally ten minutes ago, fully approved.  Mike: 01:20 We thought about going out with, hey, we’re going to have this discussion maybe, and it might be hot off the press.  Adam: 01:26 Yeah, that’s true.  Mike: 01:30 We’re going to have a Riffs, maybe, and things will happen on that thing. Anyway, I think it was kind of interesting.  Rodrigo: 01:33 We hear you. Yeah, go ahead. Adam: 01:35  We hear you big guy.  Mike: 01:38 Yeah, last night was interesting too. So,  we have up and coming guests that are that are going to help us understand how power grids and electrons are formed and how worm their way across the grids and how traders and power traders operate in that environment, I think. That’s coming up in the next few weeks. So,  we were sort of pre-gaming that a little bit yesterday evening with these gentlemen and I am super excited about that one.

and making sure that’s reliably up 99.9% of the time. Wow. That was fascinating. But yeah, as per the usual, yeah, it’s going to be a good one. So we’ve got some really good guests coming up, so just bear  with  us  as  you  have  to  struggle  through  with  the  three  of  us  on  on  a  Friday  afternoon.   And always, as a reminder, from a compliance perspective, this isn’t investment advice. In this particular case, we’re actually reviewing a research paper that Adam has spearheaded and is literally hot off the press. Just went to press, and if you’re looking for it, you’ll see it in the YouTube channel right below.   Page 2 Right there there’s, Peering Around Corners: How to Replicate Trend Following Managed Futures. You can download it there. You can also download it on Twitter. We have it there. So it is literally Hot,  Hot, like just released five minutes ago. Ten minutes ago, maybe.  So we do realize you haven’t had a chance to look at it. We’ll be circling back with this. We’ve got lots more conversations, but we thought, you know what, we’d kick it off with a little bit of discussion. And as  I  said,  not  investment  advice,  do  your  own  research. But  we’re  going  to  have  a  good,  far-ranging conversation and dig into how you might think about replication of an index or a strategy like manage futures trend following, which is trickier than you might think. And there’s some things that you have to think about in your prioritization and how you might create that thing. And I think Adam has done an absolutely  spectacular  job  trying  to  think  through  that  problem  and  convey  it  in  very  approachable terms.  Replicating the Magic Adam: 03:58Yes. Just to be also crystal clear, here Michael Harris is asking, are we marketing a product? This is absolutely not a product discussion.

discussion. This is the discussion of a research paper that explores different methodologies that people might consider using for replicating, really, any strategy. And we just applied this in particular to CTA,  trend  following  CTAs. And  there  are  maybe  some  unique  features  of  trend  following  CTAs  that might  make  it  a  little  bit  easier  to  reverse  engineer  the  underlying  holdings  or exposures  of  CTA managers in aggregate, than certain other types of indices which might hold a wide range of different products. And we may not know what the underlying products are that they might be holding. Right? Whereas with typically managed futures trend following, we’ve got a good sense of the general markets that these managers are trading on a regular basis, which gives us a real leg up. And we also have some decent  intuition  about  the  underlying  strategies  that  they  might  employ. Right. So  those  are  two important  tools  that  we  bring  to  the  analysis  that  sometimes  we  aren’t  able  to  bring  to  a  replication analysis. So made it a little easier in this case.  Rodrigo: 05:39 Yeah, it was a very interesting research cycle and the paper was quite enlightening because,  what you normally hear with a  replication  paper  is, at  least  in  the  past,  it  has  been  about  trying  to  identify  the factors that are driving returns in other mutual funds and strategies. Right? So if we think back at the original papers that Fama/French might have put out,  and even AQR, trying to replicate what Warren Buffett invests in. You know, that’s just a way of peering through the data to see how well or how it is that  they  can  replicate  the  magic  of  Warren  Buffett  in  a  unique  way.

I  think  that  that  paper  was really  interesting  because  it  was,  correct  me  if  I’m  wrong,  but  I  believe  it  was  a  levered  portfolio  of quality stocks 1.6 times,  or something to that effect. Right?  Adam: 06:32 Yeah, there was a quality exposure and then there was some inexpensive leverage that Buffett is able to  employ  by  taking  advantage  of  the  insurance  structure  that  he  uses  for  investment  purposes. And yeah,  the  authors  definitely  demonstrated  that  you  could  ex post  right,   giving  Buffett  full  credit  for having recognized this decades ago. But in the decades   since, academics have identified certain factors that explain the variation in returns across different equity portfolios. And so the AQR paper was able   Page 3 to  show  that  we  could  indeed  explain  the  excess  returns  that  Buffett  has  produced  above  just  a  cap weighted  stock  index,  by  just  generating  exposures  to  a  small  set  of  different  factors  like  value  and quality and also adding some leverage. Right? So that’s an example of something called returns based style analysis, which has been around since at least the early ninety’s, and probably long before. And the idea there is to use linear models, typically regression models, to identify the underlying exposures, and  in  some  cases  the  underlying  holdings  of  mutual  funds  or  hedge  funds  or  what  have  you.   Oftentimes it’s used to – so for example, if you’ve got a mutual fund and you’re evaluating whether the manager has skill, then you might run a returns based style analysis trying to explain the returns of that mutual  fund  using  things  like  a  long/short  value  model,   or  momentum,  or  the  market  portfolio  or different capitalization stocks, small versus large, et cetera.

if you can explain the returns of that portfolio  really  well  with  those  simple  factor  models,  then  some  people  might  argue  that  that’s  not really the manager adding his own skill because an investor can simply allocate to passive indices that give exposure to those underlying factor strategies and replicate that manager’s performance with very low fees. Right? So they can sort of circumvent the need to allocate to the manager with the manager’s higher  fees  for  active  management,   by  simply  allocating  to  a  combination  of  other  index  funds  that would otherwise replicate the performance of the manager. Right? So the approach that we took in this case was at least partially informed by this returns based style analysis approach.  Rodrigo: 09:29 Yeah, but before we get into that, I think Alpha Architect has a portal where you can go in, drop in data series and figure out how much of that manager has unique alpha,  versus can be explained by a series of factors that you can by yourself. I think also from the,  is it Two Sigma that has another portal that you can sign up for and see what can be explained, and if you find that it has many explanatory variables that are easily accessible and cheap. You might want to replicate it. And even if you’re not perfect, you’ll, you know, without the 2 and 20, you might be able to pull it off, right? And then if you don’t, if you if the thing is that you try to put the data through, see if you can replicate it and you find that 80% of it is unexplainable, then then that’s how you kind of are able to know whether there’s alpha there or not. So these are tools that are available now more than ever, that have,  and one of the key things here is what is alpha and what is beta these days, right? It’s an ever moving target that managers and allocators need to be aware of because they might be paying more than what they need to.

sort of the I don’t know, maybe everybody else knew it, but for me, it hit home that when you’re replicating from a top down perspective and you’re trying to pick up what the positions are, you’re not necessarily concerned with how they’re creating the positions, which allows you to be participating in the  innovation  under  the  surface  that’s  going  on  with  the  various  managers. Right? Whereas  when you’re creating from a bottom up perspective and you’re saying, well, what are the general strategies that  are  used  in  this  are,  and  do  an  ensembleing  of  those. So  you’re  sort  of  capturing  best  areas  and trying to get the, maximize your signal to noise ratio. You’re still not sure where the whole market itself lies with respect to its innovation on trend and how different managers might be doing very different   Page 4 things.   And even though they’re a small portion of the overall group of managers, you’re still picking up that innovation  when  you’re  top  down. Whereas  when  you’re  bottom  up,  you’re  responsible  for  that innovation. You’re responsible for understanding those in the index and how they might be managing money and understanding the strategies they might be using. And so that was something to me,  that was a really interesting realization for me,  along this particular journey. Adam 11:58 Yeah. I think we’re getting a little ahead of ourselves.  Mike: 12:02 Yeah, probably.  Adam: 12:04 It’s a good teaser, though, for sure. Right. So we do begin the paper with a discussion of why someone might consider managed futures alongside a more traditional portfolio. Right?

  now  the  Bloomberg  Aggregate  and  the  Barclay  BTOP50  CTA  Index. We  chose the  BTOP50 because it just has the longest history of CTA performance. Right?  So  each  year,  Barclays,    going  back  to  the  80s,  Barclays   selects  the  largest  managers  and  puts  them together  into  an  index. They  reconstitute  that  yearly,   based  on  changes  in  larger  managers  and aggregate  the  performance  of  those  managers. They  report  the  performance  of  this  index  monthly, going back to 1987. And it was neat to see, obviously, the blue line there is the BTOP50 CTA Index. The black line is the S&P 500. Sorry is ACWI, rather is ... Cap World Index. So a global cap-weighted index proxy. And the yellow line is the Barclays Bloomberg Aggregate Bond Index. Right. So what’s interesting to see is that they all sort of end up in the same place over, what is that now, 35 years? And obviously since bonds got there with much less volatility, they had a much higher Sharpe ratio than equities. The BTOP50 CTA index has a Sharpe ratio kind of in between bonds and stocks, but they generally have a long-term average correlation that is about zero.  Now, we all know right from 2022 that the long-term average correlation doesn’t mean much in terms of day to day, month to month and year to year. We went through a very long period where stocks and bonds, several decades anyways, where stocks and bonds effectively had a zero correlation and for the last decade, a negative correlation. And  then  along  comes  2022  with  a  major  inflationary  impulse. All  of  a  sudden,  stocks  and  bonds  are reacting  to  the  exact  same  macroeconomic  variable,  this  inflation  shock. And  so  their  correlations converge towards one, right?

towards one, right? So,  they become very highly correlated. Now, fortunately, in the recent episode,  the  CTA  index  was  actually  negatively  correlated  to  both  stocks  and  bonds. So  in  2022,  the CTAs in general acted as a really nice ballast for both stocks and bonds, as stocks and bonds correlated and began to move in the same direction at the same time for a similar reason.    Page 5 Rodrigo: 15:19 Yeah,  yeah. I  think  it’s  important  to  just  talk  a  little  bit  about  the  like  trend  following  as  a  concept. I mean, you just are showing three equity lines and they’re different. This is what we all look for, right? Things that make money over time, but do it with taking a different  path. You put them all together, you  get  a  better  result. But  why  is  it  that  trend  following  managers  have  to  have  generally  provided some much needed support in periods when equities and bonds do poorly. Can anybody tell me that? We’ll lay up for you guys...  Mike: 16:00 The ability to go short?  Rod: 16:03 Well, okay, Mike, I’ll take it if you need to. But I think the key difference here, the key value of managed futures is that you’re actually getting exposure to asset classes,  that are number one,  super liquid across equities bonds, commodities, currencies rates, right? And you’re able to short. Right? So what are the two  blind  spots  that  the 60/40  portfolio,  50/50  portfolio,   equities  and  bonds,   tend  to  have? Well, certainly  anything  that  has  equities  dominating  the  allocation  of  the  portfolio,  like  a  60/40  really  has 90% of its risk embedded in it.

So if we go to a prolonged multi year bear market, then that 60/40,  50/50 portfolio is going to be dragged down. What makes it a structural expectation for managed future strategies and trend to do, well they’re following trends. So if the trends are negative and they are prolonged, they’r e long enough to be able to capture them, you should be able to structurally find non-correlation to that equity market. And  then  what  we  see  in  2022  is  another  structural  reason  why,  you  know,  having  something  like managed futures trend in your portfolio is that when inflation goes up and rates go up, right,  you’re able to, generally speaking, bonds will go down and equities will go down, especially long duration equities, like growth stocks.  And you have the opportunity to short bonds and go long energies in inflationary regimes. So you just have access to many more levers than you did before. And what’s interesting today versus 20 years ago is that 20 years ago, it was a very specialized group of individuals, very specialized group of custodians that would give access to a subset of asset classes with less liquidity, and it was seen as alpha, right? You need it. You need, it was a big lift to be able to provide this non correlation. Today,  fast forward 20 plus  years,  we  really  have  turned  this  alpha,  you  could  say,  into  something  that’s  more  like  a  risk premium, right? Not necessarily an S&P 500, easily replicable, but it is getting closer and closer to something that the average investor and portfolio manager can actually create and replicate. And so it’s starting to become more  transparent. It’s  starting  to  become  more  accessible. There’s  more  information  out  there  than ever. We’re starting to see the value of it.

the alternative options out there for you to think about replicating, what you really want is something that has a low correlation to both bonds and equities and has an impact in periods when you need it to have an impact. And out of all the cate’ories that we see, trend following, systematic global macro,  tend to be the two that make,  that fit that bill, right? So that’s important. I think that was,  replicating a new   Page 6 beta is important and at a time where people are more accepting of this particular strategy. So, anyway, that was just to set up the idea of why trend is an important thing for portfolio construction, in our view.  Adam: 19:07 I  think  it’s  worth  also  mentioning  that  the  fact  that  we  can  effectively  replicate  a  good  portion  of  a strategy  doesn’t  mean  that  there’s  no  alpha. Right. It  doesn’t  mean  that  there’s  no  skill. There’s absolutely no doubt in my mind, knowing many of the managers of large CTA funds personally, having read their research, having spent the last decade or more doing our own internal research on managed futures,  there  is  an  enormous  amount  of  skill  that  goes  into  running  a  managed  futures  portfolio.   I think the whole idea here is that there is an element, or there’s a portion of those returns that are able to  be  systematically  replicated. And  that’s what we’re  seeking  to  do  here  now. Right? And  if  you  can replicate  a  good  chunk  of  what’s  going  on  at  those  highly  skilled  CTA  firms  and  you  can  do  it  with considerably  lower  fees  than  those  firms  charge,  then  maybe  there’s  a  fee  alchemy.

hilarious.  Adam: 20:34 He did, too. There’s a fee alpha that might be able to be harvested. And I want to talk a little bit about the idea of alpha and beta, right,  because you’ve sort of mentioned this a few times, Rodrigo. And alpha and beta, they do have technical definitions, but I like to think about alpha as really being very unique for every investor, because what a large, sophisticated institution might perceive as alpha is probably different  than  what  a  typical  retail  investor  might  consider  alpha, right? Alpha  really  is  what  you personally  can’t  access  cheaply  and  easily,   right? Or  in  other  words,  beta  is  something  that  you  can access cheaply and easily,  right?  A  sophisticated  Institution  may  be  able  to  replicate  or  run  a  high  quality  managed  futures  program internally  and  not  need  to  outsource  that  to  other  external  managers,  right? So  for  them, managed features is purely beta. But for a retail investor, they may have difficulty accessing top managers. They definitely can’t access top managers for very low fees. And so,  to whatever extent we can turn some portion of the skill that’s being applied in managed futures funds into to a cheap beta and offer it for lower fees, or one can,  then that’s a form of alpha that we can or not we, but one might be able to offer retail investors that they didn’t have access to before.  Rodrigo: 22:18 Yeah, go ahead, Mike, go ahead.  Mike: 22:20 The other thing is,  you think about the idea of,  so I’m going to do some trend following and managed futures. Okay,  so  where  should  we  start? Should  we  start  with  trying  to  pick  a  number  of  different managers where the dispersion in this area is very large, it is quite different?

should we start with trying  to  capture  the  main  portion  of  what  people  are  trying  to  do  and  then  build  around  that  with managers who we may be paying higher fees to, in order for them to capture unique viewpoints on this trend? Or if your bias is,    I actually want more short-term trend following and the major indexes skew away  from  that? The  major  sort  of  replication  stuff  when  you’ll  read  in  the  paper  is  that  the  shorter term    side    of    the    trend    following    is    from    the    index’s     perspective,    largely    nonexistent.    Page 7  And that may be for a few very good reasons that we could speculate on. But so what is the core to this type of thing? And then where might I want to explore? What are my biases? Do I think it’s really long trend  following? Do  I  think  it’s  really  short? Do  I  think  I  need  a  lot  of  mean  reversion  in  my  trend following? Like, what are the things that I might want to add? But you can have a core of this replication at a lower fee. So it’s not to say that, I don’t think it’s to say that you want to replace all of it. You still want to look for,  as Adam alluded to, there’s some really thoughtful, cutting edge CTAs that are,  you’re kind of looking for those edge cases where yeah, I’m replicating the market and I’m going to get a lot of that innovation. But where do I think the innovation might be real? And where would I want to place asset bets or exposures to capitalize on that, and see if I’m right to some degree, said in that way?  Rodrigo: 24:12 So, for example, we know a lot of people love Warren Buffett, love the way he chooses stocks.

the whole point. That’s  the  whole  jam. He’s got some structural components in there with the insurance policy, what he can invest in, how long he can invest in, and what leverage he can utilize. And so there’s clearly some alpha there that people who can get access to it, got access to it early and are able to do better than the S&P,  you can. And institutions also search for managers with cutting edge,  all the time. They have a team that helps them do that and put things together, right? The average retail investor has largely decided that they’re not good at that, necessarily, so they buy passive indices, right?   Instead of trying to pick a handful of really thoughtful US equity managers across that whole spectrum, a lot of people have decided to just buy the S&P 500 very cheap. So reduce the fees, get the big muscle movement  of  the  S&P,  and  forget  about  the  the  bells  and  whistles,  right? In  a  similar  way,  trying  to identify,  and  trying  to  get  access  to  the  top  CTA  managers,  they  may  not  even  and  likely  don’t  go  to retail. Right. And so, you know, what is the best way of doing an S&P 500-like index? You know, a way of doing that could be to replicate the BTOP50, the S,  and the SOCGEN Trend Index, the SOCGEN CTA Index, because it does,  it is representative largely of that kind of big muscle movement. And also, you know, if you’re replicating that, you’re going to get it at a level of risk that is common, you know, across all these managers and what they offer, generally. Other bells and whistles you can add or take away.   And as an institution, a lot of them prefer this is,  they’re looking for 20 to 25 volatility targeted CTAs because  when  they  put  them  together,  that  volatility  could  collapse  and  go  way  down.

And  so this is about giving the best for the most, right? Also, if you’re going to be building something for the masses, you want to make sure that it’s as liquid as possible. You’re probably going to want to take away some of the smaller markets out there to ensure that you get that consistency and that liquidity across the                                                                                                                                                                      board.

Unless you go and buy all the managers in the index or buy units in the funds of all the managers in the index. So, people typically gain access to the, don’t bring that up. That’s not – that is false.  Mike: 27:23 I totally agree. Yeah. If, like, you got to say, like, again, like, we have to drink every, like, time.

people typically buy one or two or maybe a small basket of funds. Typically. I think a retail investor would just buy one, maybe. So that can be problematic because what goes on under the hood for any individual managed futures fund can mean that the return experience for that fund could deviate quite dramatically from the index, and from all the other funds in the index,  over reasonably long periods of time.  So what we’re showing here, each of these yellow splurges here illustrates the dispersion of individual managed  futures  mutual  funds  in  each  calendar  year,  right? So  the  one  on  the  far  left  Is  2018,  then 2019. And so,  it just shows sort of the dispersion in the return experienced by all those different funds in that year. And you can see that, for example, in 2022, over on the far right, some managers of the mutual funds that we use, that were representative, that we just drew from the Morningstar Managed Futures category,  actually had negative returns in 2022. And then there were other funds that delivered returns greater than 30%, right? So there’s a very large dispersion.  And  you  can  see  in  each  of  the  other  years,  there  is  still  a  fairly  largish  dispersion. On  average,  it’s probably five or 6% per year. And that’s on average. And if you you just happen to get unlucky or lucky, that could be very substantial and that may compound over several years. So just choosing an individual fund may not be an optimal way to gain general exposure to the category, right. Your experience may vary. And so this is sort of another motivation for, if you want general exposure to managed futures as a concept, maybe allocating to something that tries to replicate the index may be a better alternative than trying to choose any individual fund.

so  you’re  also  faced  with  the  challenge  of  understanding,  was  it  skill  or  was  it  just  that  this  is  the repetitive process that they use, a process that they use, wherever you are in the world. So short-term trend  followers  had  a  lot  of  trouble  for  a  long  time. And  maybe  that’s  why  we  don’t see a lot of that reflected in the index anymore. Because you go through a decade of really getting punched in the face and all of a sudden,  the area dries up and they’re there’s not too many professionals even practicing that type of thing anymore. And so was it their skill or was it that they were unlucky in this particular   Page 9 set  of  circumstances  didn’t  manifest  in  their  favor  for  a  decade,  and  then  what  will  happen  over  the coming decade? And so it’s an interesting, when you’re thinking about trying to disentangle the features of  somebody’s  sort  of  ethos,  or  what  they  feel  is  in  their  domain  of  expertise  and  how  they’ve determined that they would look at the lens of trend following, is it just that that particular thing laid over top of a really opportune period of time? Or is it that they have skill and they actually are changing these types of environments? So just to say that it’s really hard to try and figure out who the best trend followers within the trend following space might be, and is it skill or is it a little bit of luck, as we’ve had many discussions on previously.  Adam: 31:48 Yeah, there’s a lot of discussion in the chat about what the Lost Decade, which the managed futures category did have a rough period in the 20-teens. The question is, well, if a strategy can go through that kind of Lost Decade, then is it worth allocating to? So, a few thoughts.

 longer  than  that  in  real  terms,  right? The  S&P  has  also  had  very  negative  real  returns  through several other decades, over the last hundred or more. Bonds have also gone through very long, 40, 45 year  periods  of  negative  real  returns. So  I  don’t  think  anyone’s  making  the  case  that  trend  following managed  futures  are  a  panacea. I  think  we  have  often  made  the  case  that  you  want  to  have  a  core exposure to global equities, to global fixed income, to global commodities, to trend following managed futures, to other types of global macro strategies and other diversifiers, if you can, where you have faith and you can get access to them. And yeah, we should, absolutely. You should expect that each one of them are going to go through lost decades. That’s the nature of the game. Right. The point is, I think this actually makes the case for us,  right?  So,  Michael Harris put in the chat that, you know, there was a 2% per year, or there was a decade where the managed futures index compounded at 2% a year, which was slightly negative after inflation. At the same  time  the  S&P  went  up  11%  a  year. That’s  the  point,  right? That’s  why  you  want  to  own  both managed futures and stocks and bonds in the portfolio, because you never know which one of them are going to go on to deliver the performance that you need over your investment horizon, right? And the more bets you have in the portfolio, the more likely you are to generate the returns that you need to support  whatever  your  financial  objectives  are  over  your  unique,  personal,  limited,  finite  investment horizon.

 yeah,  diversification,  man, get after it.  Rodrigo: 34:38 And it’s also like what I was looking at this table, and Table 1 in the paper and just observing, you got from 1990 to today, you got MSCI at Barclays AG and the BTOP50, all roughly returning the same, and it’s six. These are total returns, right? These aren’t excess returns, Adam. Those are total returns. Yeah, yeah. So they may seem a little anemic, right? Six, five, 5%. But the benefit, like with the whole concept that we’ve been talking about, return stacking.   Page 10 You know, depending on what your risk tolerance is, if you’re stacking six on top of five, on top of five, if that’s ,  if you have a high risk tolerance. And remember, these are non correlated return streams, so it’s not like you’re stacking, you’re stacking those returns, but you will not necessarily be stacking the same amount of risk to the portfolio, right? The volatility will go up, but it won’t necessarily go up by the same level as your return, your expected future return, right?  So again, you go through a decade where after inflation, trend does zero and the S&P does eleven,  and you’re stacking one on top of the other, well, then you got your eleven. Then you go through a decade like the 2000 and 2010 period where the S&P does zero and trend does double digit,  well now you stack double digit. And then there’s everything in between when they’re both making money, right? So I think again,  I  think  a  lot  of  times  we  have  these  discussions,  we’re  still  stuck  in  this  whole  paradigm  of  the canvas being 100%,  where you have to give up some of your favorite things in order to get some of the diversification.   I think today, in today’s environment and with the options available out there, you can do,  you can have your cake and eat it too in terms of diversity and stacking.

something to consider there.  Mike: 36:33 It’s also interesting,  that period of time has one predominant direction of interest rates. Pretty sure that acts as a tailwind in the bond market,  definitionally. That’s something that might account for that slightly higher Sharpe ratio from bonds over that period of time.  Rodrigo: 36:50 What do we think about this comment from Sean? “Non correlation of managed futures to bonds and stocks may not be inherent to managed futures, but in fact is selection bias”. It’s possible.  Adam: 37:01 He’s going to have to clarify.  Rodrigo: 37:04 I think maybe Sean, you can describe this, but I think what he’s saying is we saw an equity line we liked ex post. And  then  we  put  it  in  because  we  hope  that  it  does  the  same  in  the  future, without  really understanding what’s underneath. Whereas I think we can make a case, and I think I did earlier, as to why  it  is  likely  a  structural  reality  that  managed  futures  will  continue  to  provide  conditional  non correlation, r ight, conditional non correlation.  Mike: 37:41 Rod, do you mean trend managed futures or ... Rodrigo: 37:44 Yeah,  we’re  talking  about  trend  managed  futures  here. So  I’m  actually  talking  about  trend  managed futures. So specifically, you can create a base case for why the correlation needs to be there. If you have multiple time frames and look-back periods for trend, where you’re going to be long and short these different  things,  right? So  it  may  not  give  you  a  high  level  of  confidence that there might be a return there, although we can make a case on that, for that, with regard to Shannon’s Demon and Rebalancing Premium, where that’s maybe where the returns are coming from, regardless of whether trend provides positive outcomes.

is likely to continue over time.    Page 11 Adam: 38:25 Yeah, I don’t think we have conviction that the low correlation exists. Our conviction doesn’t come from the past history of low correlation. Our conviction comes from the mechanics of how the markets are traded,  right, correct. First of all, there’s probably, over half the markets traded are not even related to stocks  and  bonds,   right. They’re  commodities. And  commodities  in  general  have  approximately  zero long-term  correlation  to  both  stocks  and  bonds. So  there’s  that. The  other  thing  is  they,   managed features trade long and short, without bias. So, definitionally they’re going to be uncorrelated. We’re not suggesting that they’re going to be negatively correlated. There’s going to be periods where they’re going to be positively correlated,  and then there’s going to be other periods where they’re going to be negatively  correlated,  and  it’ll  be  largely  random,  the  times  when  they’re  positively  and  negatively correlated which means, you know, you probably shouldn’t try to time your allocation. But over time, structurally and mechanically, they’re going to be uncorrelated just because of the way that they trade without bias, long and short and because half the markets they are allocated to are uncorrelated stocks and bonds.  Universes Mike:                                                                                                                                                                                                                  39:35 It might be good to show the universe from the paper, maybe after whatever point you’re going to make here.  Rodrigo: 39:42 Well, this is just kind of showing the condition, because one of the things is correlation. When we say correlation we’re talking about the average, right? But in reality,  the correlation of managed futures to bonds or managed futures to equities is like having your head in the freezer and your feet in the fire.

kind of the trajectory of the SOCGEN Trend Index against ACWI and Bloomberg Global Aggregate Bond Index and you can see that it is,  by virtue of being a trend follower, when the trends are strong on the upside,  it will be correlated to equities. When  the  trends  are  negatively  to  the  downside,   it’ll  be  negatively  correlated  and  that’s  kind  of  by design. So,  from the fundamental understanding of what it’s doing underneath the hood, that’s kind of, also because a lot of times the other asset classes away from equities and bonds may be correlated to equities that you’re long,  or you might be actually out of equities and might be long commodities,  but commodities happen to be correlated to equities. And so back to Mike’s point,  what is it that managed futures trade in? Think the universe is here?  Adam: 40:40 While you’re  pulling  that  up,  I  want  to  address  the  capacity  issue  that’s  been  raised  by  Sean  Wylan  a couple times asserting that if too many people allocate to managed futures,  then the edge will go away. I want to echo Brian Moriarty’s comment that that is true of every,  of every strategy, including market beta, and also that there’s absolutely no evidence that that’s true. Right. So that the total CTA category is about $150,000,000,000 after you net out Bridgewater, which is not a trend following strategy at all.     Page 12 So  it’s $150,000,000,000. And  it  hasn’t  really  changed  much. It  doesn’t  change  much. Ah,  you  know, went  up  by  like  a  couple,  $10  billion  after  the  2008  financial  crisis. We  haven’t really seen much  of  a change in flows despite its fantastic performance in 2022.  The fact is it's,  just it’s actually a hard sleeve to allocate to.

does go through multi year periods where it underperforms stocks. Most people have very strong risk aversion to tracking error of domestic equity indices  and  just  can’t  stand  to  not  be  participating  in  the  stock  market  when  all  their  buddies  are participating in it,  and seem to be getting rich around them. It’s just a really hard thing to allocate to. So from that perspective, there is a little bit of a risk premium built into it. Michael Harris asking,  futures a zero sum? Yes,  definitionally futures are a zero sum.  So  who’s  on  the  other  side? Well,  typically,  I’ve  been  trying  to  find  this  paper,  but  the  IMF  put  out  a paper  in  2011  that  demonstrated  that  large  institutions,  they  examined  insurance  companies,  public pensions, private pensions, endowments, and foundations. And  what  they  discovered  is  that  they  typically  chase  performance,  but  at  exactly  the  wrong  time horizon. And they showed evidence that that may be one of the contributors to why trends exist. If you look  at  major  institutions,  if  you  look  at  retail,  at  the  money- weighted  returns  of  institutions  and  of retail investments in mutual funds, etc.,  the money-weighted returns show that most people are really bad timers. They chase returns over two or three year periods in both directions and so they over-chase after a period of strong performance and they over-sell during periods of poor performance,  and that drives markets in the underlying, drives strategies in the underlying markets and instruments that they hold,  to trend at different horizons, right?

 whole  idea  of  carry  and  the  way  the  term structure  might  be  forming  in  the  particular  contract  has  a  return  to  it,  and  that  return  is  a  return  of preference and all kinds of things like storage and whatnot, and getting things through bottlenecks, and getting things through periods of time, or crop sessions, that outside of this system, where it appears that  there’s  two  people  that  are  on  each  side  of  every  futures  contract,  that’s  true,  but  there  are external forces where a producer of goods and a consumer of goods will want to have price certainty over a time frame, and they meet at a price which gives a risk premium to those speculators that are offering liquidity to that market.  So, whilst it appears to be zero sum inside the game, there is a broader,  outside of the game, where, that there’s preferences that are not just tied to the actual price. There’s actually,  we could call them willing  losers,  but  they’re  just  trying  to  hedge  off  some  other  thing  that  they’ve  got  on  their  balance sheet to worry about. And so,  they would rather price certainty and someone else’s  taking on that price uncertainty in order to garner a return. So it’s not zero, it’s not quite a zero sum thing. Rodrigo: 45:32 No. It’s like only seeing one leg of the trade, right. If a hedger comes in and is willing to,  even though they may believe that the market is going to go up in price, they need to reduce the volatility of their cash flows so that they can go out to the capital markets and raise new IPO or go out to the bank and raise some cash.

them willing losers, but in fact they’re winning and the whole is greater than sum of the parts, right?  Rodrigo: 46:00 So  these  are  the  elements  that  kind  of  are  explanatory  variables  as  to  why  we’ve  seen  a  positive outcome from speculating and providing the other side of the bet. Another interesting one that I really liked back in the day when we had Chris Schindler in the podcast,  is the idea of Queueing Theory, right?   Mike alluded to bottlenecks as a thing, and you should listen to the podcast because he’ll do a better job than I did. But the idea of Queueing Theory, which I think is an operations research kind of idea, is that you have a bunch of tellers that can take X amount of customers at a set amount of time. Like they can take one customer per minute and people, as long as people line up and one customer comes in per minute  and  they’re  able  to  clear  those  tellers  easily,  there  is  no  issue,  there  is  no  bottlenecks.   But the moment that you start randomizing which customer goes to which cashier, you all of a sudden start  getting  these  bottlenecks  and  start  in  the,  think  about  commodities. Commodities  don’t  clear easily, right? We have five long year, five long year cycles where or more, depending on the commodity, where  you  might  have  demand  and  there’s  enough  production  in  order  to  be  able  to  say  shit. That demand, the demand dries up, people stop producing. And then it’s, these bottlenecks and Queueing Theory that may create may make commodities, in particular, more susceptible to trending, right? So these are all things that you guys can ...  Mike: 47:38 Think of oil being at negative, what was it, $30 in March of 2020 or whatever it was.  Adam 47:44 Yeah.

And  that’s the bottleneck and that’s the problem. And so then you get creative solutions on that of where that’s going to go and what the risk premia, what the cost is for that to go to those other places and what people are willing to pay for it. In fact, there’s a wonderful story. As part of a hazing when you come into, a former colleague of ours  told  us  this  story  about,  when  you  come  into  the  futures  trading  desks  and  some  of  the  high frequency  shops,  what  they  will  do  is  tell  you  that  they’ve  actually  been  assigned  several  hundred thousand head of cattle and it’s being delivered. So, you got to find a place for it. To teach them how you don’t want to be assigned any of these contracts. And they run these juniors around to try and find places, which by the way is literally impossible to do.  And if it’s possible, it’s extremely expensive to do. And so they just want to emphasize that you don’t want to get caught in these situations. We’ve tricked you. It’s fine. You don’t have to find a place for for 2000 head of cattle. But if you did, you now know that the saliency of why you’re going to want to close that contract before you take delivery.    Page 14 The Nitty Gritty of Replication Rodrigo: 48:51 Okay, let’s shift away from the the trend side of things and go back to the replication side of things,  and maybe we can get into the nitty gritty of replication,  Adam? And what’s unique about replicating a fast moving trend strategy versus other things, for example. Why don’t we get into that?  Adam: 49:12 Yeah,  absolutely.

there was a product launched a couple of years ago  that’s  been  very  successful  and  done  a  good  job  of  tracking  the  CTA  index. And  there  have  been plenty of papers written about hedge fund replication. There’s a particularly good one by Lars Kesner on CTA Replication. So,  we drew inspiration from the literature and from successful products as well. My understanding is that some of the more successful products that do replicate the hedge fund index use what we term to be a top down approach, right? So with the top down approach, you’re sort of looking back over the last 20, 30, 40 days of returns of the  underlying  index. And  you’re  using  regression  analysis,  a  robust  regression  analysis  called  ridge regression to or elastic net to figure out what combination of assets in a portfolio, if you were to hold those assets over that same period, would best track the returns of the underlying index,  right?  This is the same concept, exactly the same as a returns based style analysis. And by the way, there are more sophisticated ways to do this, right? You could use RNN, you could use a LSTM,  long/short term memory type, neural network model, which would account for the fact that the holdings auto correlate through time, et cetera, et cetera.  In the paper, we kept it pretty simple. We just used an ensemble of rolling  regressions  where  so,  for example, look back over the past 20 days. We’ve got a basket of instruments that we’re going to use to explain the movements of the underlying index,  and then we’re going to try to create a portfolio that best mimics those movements. Right? So it’s called top down. So we just use a 20 day, 25 day, 30 day, 35 day, and 40 day. And then the question is, well, how do you weight the shorter-term models versus the longer-term models?

and, to find whether we want to give the longer-term models higher weight or the shorter-term models  higher  weight,  at  each  individual  point  in  time,  right? And  then  we  just  took  the  weighted average of the weights that came out of each of those different models,  and that became the sort of top  down  explanatory  portfolio  on  that  day,  for  what  is  probably  close  to  the  underlying  holdings  in aggregate of managers in the index.  Rodrigo: 52:13 So,   this  would  be,  again,  going  back  to  Buffett,  just  to  keep  it  simple,  this  would  be  what  the  AQR approach would have been, as to trying to identify the weights and then replicate it.  Adam: 52:25 It’s a little different, I think, because I think that the Buffett one is a little closer to the, a little closer to the bottom up, I think,  right? Because the idea is you’re trying to use the same process to select stock   Page 15 that  Buffett  used,  right? Whereas  in  this  case,  we’re  literally  just  trying  to  figure  out  what  are  the underlying                                                                                                                                                     holdings.   So this has some benefits. As Mike mentioned earlier, the benefit of this type of top down replication is that  if  you  don’t  have  a  good  understanding  of  the  likely  methods  that  the  underlying  managers  are using to inform what goes into the portfolios, then you could just, you know, you could just see or try to look through to approximate what their holdings are,  through time. And therefore you’re going to be able to take advantage of any innovation, as Mike mentioned, that might be going on in the space, right.  Please  keep  in  mind  these  trend  following  managers,  many  of  them  have  been  around  for  decades.  They’re constantly innovating.

of some of those innovations through time. On the downside, you’re trying to mimic what’s in the portfolio over the last kind of 20 to 40 days. A regression analysis, even robust regression analyses, can come up with relatively noisy approximations when the number of observations you’re using to fit the model is relatively small, relative to the number of variables.  Rodrigo: 54:01 So, for example, even in our small universe that we’re going to – so we should probably go through the universes.  Adam: 54:10 Yeah, let’s go through the universes. Maybe actually,  just can you pull up the universe thing again? So, for the top down modeling process, we use both a small universe, which is nine markets, and a larger universe, which is 20 or 27 markets. And you can see although it’s not super clear in this image, but you can see that the small universe is a subset of the larger universe, and the holdings in the small universe have a red square around them.  So, for example, FV,  TY, TU, US. Yeah, if you zoom in, you can see right, so there’s nine markets. It’s just meant  to  be  sort  of  a  small  representative  basket. You’ve  got  some  bonds,  you’ve  got  some  equity markets,  you’ve  got  oil, CL,  you’ve  got  gold,  right? And  that’s  pretty  well,  you’ve  got  a  couple  of currencies, euro and yen and that’s pretty well it,  whereas the medium sized universe, we just add more markets in each of the different categories,  right. For the purpose of creating an index that can be easily scaled to many hundreds or of millions or even billions of dollars, we left out any illiquid markets where investors might face some constraints in terms of CFTC limits, et cetera, right?

 for  the  reasons  I discussed,  you’ve  got  nine  markets  that  you’re  using  to  explain  returns  over  20,  30,  40  days.   That  regression  is  going  to  be  noisy. The  models  are  going  to  be  noisy,  even  with  the  regularization techniques  that  we  use. And  so,   that  is  definitely  a  downside  of  top  down  models. And  also  what’s interesting  to  see  is  that, maybe  just  go  on  to  the  next  one,  if  you  don’t  mind,  is  that  the  top  down model and the bottom up sorry, the top down small universe model and the top down medium sized universe model had slightly different return trajectories,  right? They’re reasonably highly correlated –   Page 16 correlation of about 0.7 between them, but they outperform and underperform and track the index in a relatively better or worse way at different points in time,  right? So what’s great about that is that you can combine them and get sort of the best of both worlds there. And so this is what you see. The yellow line is the top down medium universe. Black line is the top down small universe, and then the blue line obviously is a combination of the two, right? They all kind of meet at the same, in the same place. The combination  does  a  little  bit  better  on  a  risk-adjusted  returns  basis  because  you’re  getting  the  the diversification benefits between the two types of models.  And the combination strategy also tracks the underlying SOCGEN Trend Index a bit more closely than either of them on its own,  right. So a perfectly reasonable approach to use,  my understanding is,  that this is a closer approximation to what some of the more popular CTA tracking ETFs use under the hood and it does reasonably well, right.

57:51 Let’s talk about the pros of that. Once again, just to summarize, I know we’ve already addressed them. So what are the pros of an approach like this from a replication perspective?  Adam 58:05 The pros are that you are directly trying to mimic what’s going on in the underlying manager portfolios. So you need to make fewer assumptions about the strategies that the managers are employing in order to create the portfolios, right? You’re literally just trying to mimic what they’re doing. You’re not making any  assumptions. You’re  making  some  assumptions  about  the  markets  that  they’re  probably  trading within them, right? But we know in general that most CTAs try to trade across a broad basket of markets.  A  bunch  of  equity  indices,  bond  indices,  commodities,  currencies,  some  of  them  trade  more  exotic indices, calendar spreads, et cetera. But sort of broadly, that is a representative basket of the exposures that most of the managers are employing, right? The drawbacks of using this kind of approach are that you may be out of sync in terms of your modeling with changes in the portfolio,  if they’re happening relatively quickly.  So,  you  know,  we’re  looking  at  the  performance  of  the  portfolio  over  the  last  20  to  40  days. There’s obviously a lag between our models and what our models are representing that the underlying funds are holding,  and the changes that might be going on within the underlying funds,  based on their unique mechanics that they’re using to drive their portfolio selection,  right? So pros and cons that the bottom up method can fill in some of the gaps on. Rodrigo: 59:35 And so the detraction is that it might be a little delayed. Now how often in the paper are you refreshing the portfolio or rebalancing the portfolio? Adam: 59:46 Every day.  Rodrigo: 59:49 So this is a daily rebalance.

okay, so that’s top down approach. Now let’s get into the bottom up approach and why that was a separate useful tool.    Page 17 Adam: 01:00:01 Yeah, sounds good. So the great thing about managed futures is that we have a general intuition about the strategies, the general strategies that people are using, that these managers use to identify trends, right? Some  managers  use  moving  averages,  moving  average  cross,  double  moving  average  cross, breakout strategies, et cetera. It may seem like these strategies would produce very different profiles.   In  reality,   they  overlap  by  quite  a  bit. Shorter-term  breakout  strategies  have  a  lot  in  common  with shorter-term  time  series  momentum  strategies,  and  certain  types  of  moving  average  strategies,  and double moving average strategies, et cetera. And we can see that as we sort of look through the results of our bottom up analysis. But the idea here,  is we have a general intuition, they’re using, you know, past returns over look-back horizon,  somewhere in the neighborhood of,  call it,  20 to 300 days to inform whether a market is in an uptrend or a downtrend, right?  So  if  the  past  20  day  returns  were  positive,  then,  you  know,  the  shorter-term  trend  portion  of  the manager’s strategy would obviously be looking to hold a long position in that market and vice versa for negative returns and short positions,  right? But what we don’t know is what markets are they trading and  in  what  proportion,  right? And  what  strategies  are  they  employing? Are  they  skewing  towards shorter-term strategies or are they skewing towards longer-term strategies,  right? So what we do is we take a representative basket of all of these different markets, the 27 markets in our medium universe, and   we   run   simple   trend   following   strategies   on   each   of

 we’re running a short-term trend strategy on oil futures, a short-term trend strategy on S&P futures, et cetera, et cetera, right? Medium-term trend strategy on oil futures, medium-term on equity futures, across all the different futures markets and across a wide variety of different trend length specifications from about 20 days up to about 250 and 300 days,  right? And then we use, again, ridge regression or robust regression in order to identify the market,  the market strategy combination,  that best explains the returns of the managed futures index, right?  Maybe  you  can  put  up,  I  think  it’s Figure 3,  Rodrigo,  because  I  think  it’s  interesting  to  dig  into  the, specifically the trend lengths. So how the trend lengths were emphasized. Here we go,  where the trend lengths were emphasized.  So obviously the managers in the CTA Trend Index, they don’t really trade short-term trends, right? We did allude to this earlier. Typically they skew towards longer-term trends. In fact, about, I think, 95% of the weight across all these different strategies went to strategies with greater than 90 day look backs, right? So,  you can see this in the chart. This is Figure 7 for those listening, I’m going to follow along later. So not figure three. Yeah. Which makes me think that maybe the numbering may be off in the figures anyways.   But this  figure  shows  that  the  260  day  return  is  most  widely  used  by  trend  followers  across  all  the different markets,  right. Some people might also be wondering what markets were chosen.

18 received  different  weightings  in  terms  of  what  trend  length  exposures  were  allocated  to  within  the model,  right? But  I  think  this  is  consistent  with  our  intuition  that  most  of  the  managers  in  the  trend index,  large  managers,  tend  to  trade  based  on  longer-term  trends  for  a  few  reasons,  one  of  which  is liquidity,  right. Longer-term trends just incur a lot. You’re not trading nearly as much,  right. So you’re incurring less trading costs, and you’re also not incurring a lot of trade frictions as you, as you’re going in and out of positions.  So just in general, as you listen to trend, big trend following managers describe their process, most of them will typically say, we allocate to sort of intermediate to long-term trends. And we do observe that in the data. Mike: 01:05:23 Yeah,  and  I  think  there’s  a  liquidity  issue  there,  too,  spreading  the  bets  across  multiple  contracts, quarters, because you do run into a challenge with respect to capacity if you’re just trading the front month, and if you’re shorter-term, it becomes harder.  Rodrigo: 01:05:44 And short-term managers exist out there, and they have their place, and they don’t take a lot of money. They provide their alpha for a small group of investors, and then that’s it. So,  it’s just not, again, broadly something you can make broadly available to...  Mike: 01:06:00 No, precisely. It’s really tough to index that or bring that to the masses in a cheap way.  Rodrigo: 01:06:09 All right, so in contrast to top down, we just described bottom up. What are the pros of bottom up in contrast to top down?

also has lower turnover than the  top  down,  and  it  has  just  better  long-term  performance  as  well. So,  but  we’re  making  some assumptions,  right? So,  the  drawback  here  is  that  we’re  making  an  assumption  about  the  underlying processes that managed futures managers are using to identify trends. And if the processes that we’re bringing to the table to model the returns don’t overlap to a meaningful extent with the strategies that are used in aggregate by the underlying funds, then we could be in error. There could be some more dispersion between what we hold in the Replication Portfolio and what the actual managers are holding in the index, right?  Rodrigo: 01:07:10 Yeah. So  in  the  one  case  you’re  getting,   the  top  down  allows  you  to  evolve  faster  as  the  manager evolving their strategies and their trend links and the like. So if the goal here is to replicate that index, you will be closer to that. Whereas the bottom up approach is,  it’ll take a little while longer to reassess and re-mine the new types of strategies that they might be deploying. So a little bit less agile in terms of innovation, but likely more agile if things don’t largely change too much,  right? More agile in that you are getting in and out of markets as they trigger, in contrast to looking back, having a bit of a lag and using the performance in order to inform whether it should be long or short.  Adam: 01:08:03 Yeah. So actually we did some experiments that I think it is worth discussing. And I guess that would be Figure 8, Rodrigo. I’m hoping so. The question is, first of all, does our modeling work? Is that Figure 8?   Page 19 No. Then it’s the one before that. Okay, go up one more. Yeah. Okay, perfect.

  can   model   the   underlying   strategies   and   markets   that   go   into   that   index   relatively   well.   But the question is, does, will that work out well, out of sample, right? So what we did to test that, is we  used  something  called  k-fold  cross  validation,  which  is  a  very  common  technique  in  data  science, where you take 90% of the data and you fit a model. So in this case, we’re going to try and replicate the CT, the SG Trend Index, using our market strategy  pairs  as  explanatory  variables  over  90%  of  the  the term of the underlying index. And then we’re going to generate the weights that we should allocate to those market strategy pairs,  and then we’re going to apply those weights to the 10% of the data that the models were not fit on and see how they do,  right? So is the exposures that we’re  identifying that drive the portfolio changes in the SG Trend Index in one period, do they persist in another period,  right? Are they relatively stable through time?  So what we did here, the blue line here, is actually where we took the first 90%, used the fit, applied it to the final 10%, and then we took the final 90%, made a fit, applied it to the first 10%. And so we did, we divided it up like that, in the ten different sections, and then we just stitched together all of the out- of  -sample results. That’s the blue line. The yellow line is if we just did a full fit on the entire sample from 2000 and saw how that explained the underlying models,  and you can see by virtue of the fact that the dark blue line and the yellow line overlap each other almost perfectly, they have a correlation of over .99, that the  styles  or  the  strategies  and  markets  that  are  identified  by  this  underlying  process  are  highly stable and consistent through time.

model the underlying processes using the full series, and that those underlying models are likely to be go on and perform similarly well in tracking the index in the future. Rodrigo: 01:11:22 Yeah. And just,  Mike says something that is very interesting, that that outlier in 2014 looks interesting. 2014, 2015, that was due largely to a 75% collapse in the energy markets and the commodity markets in that period. If you look at that, that is a clear defined trend that lasted long and went for 75%,  rare events. But that’s the advantage of having that the ability to trend follow commodities when you have a bond and equity portfolio, right?  Mike: 01:11:52 Well, I think that’s the whole point is, it’s kind of going to be like lightning. This is why trying to time the allocation from the perspective of picking it, with trying to think that something’s going to happen, is tricky. You have to kind of have the allocation for when the thing that creates the opportunity, happens.  Adam: 01:12:04 Absolutely. And I like to some extent,  how some of the trend followers, like Jerry Parker, describe trend following as outlier hunting, right? You’re really looking for these external, extremely large, persistent moves   that you have no idea which market it’s going to happen to, you have no idea when. But we do know that market returns are highly non- normal. They’re highly .... Many of them are highly skewed. And so trend following is able to pick up on some of those major outlier moves, and that’s what makes those big outlier years for some of them.    Page 20 Mike: 01:12:59 Cut your losses, ride your winners. Yeah. As trite as that is, it is the waiting for those lottos, or as Mike says, the lottos or those outlier events to occur, capitalizing on them and then waiting for the next one.

But then you have, whenever there’s an extreme positive or negative event, there’s convexity to the strategy that provides that diversity. So that, again, structural. We’ve seen it, we can explain it, we can understand it, and that gives us confidence that it’s likely to be there in the future.  The whole point of this paper is to identify interesting ways. And I know you and Andrew Butler, the CIO at ReSolve Canada, worked really hard to kind of use the right techniques and put them together in a way that makes sense. So what is the best approach here from a ReSolve perspective? We pick one over the other?  Adam: 01:14:00 Yeah. So,  I  mean,  as  usual,  at  least  for  the  purpose  of  the  paper,  we  just  decided  to  give  50%  of  the weight to the top down approach and 50% to the bottom up because they complement one another’s strengths  and  weaknesses,  right? The  bottom  up  one  suffers  from  the  fact  that  we  may  not  have  a totally representative set of strategies to explain the returns of the underlying index, but it is a lot more consistent over time. It does a better job of tracking the index and has overall better performance,  and a  lot  less  turnover. The  top  down  has  the  benefit  of  being  able  to  react  to  whatever  underlying innovations  are  happening  in  the  funds because  we’re  just  looking  through  and  trying  to  capture  the holdings  of  the  funds  from  day  to  day. But  we  also  may  be  wildly  out  of  sync  from  time  to  time  with portfolio holdings,  because of the lag between the period that we’re assessing the fit over, and what may be happening in the underlying portfolios,  from time to time.

empirically. When you put them together, they just do a better job of tracking the index, and they have demonstrated better long-term performance. Maybe you can put that up, Rodrigo.  Rodrigo: 01:15:36 Yes. Looking for it? Yes. That’s Figure 8. That’s the one you’re looking for, right?  Adam: 01:15:50 Yes, that’s the one. Yeah.  Rodrigo: 01:15:53 This requires some explanation.  Adam: 01:15:57 Yeah. So, first of all, this is all excess returns,  okay? For futures   strategies, you deposit some margin, and you’re able to get a lot of exposure for having very few dollars available to you, right? So,  what I didn’t do here is include collateral yields. Typically with managed futures, you post collateral at an FCM, like a futures   trader, and then you use that collateral, which is relatively small, relative to the size of the actual exposures you’re getting. You’ll  typically  get  a  yield  on  that  collateral. So  they’ll  invest  that  collateral,  they’ll  give  you  some, probably a discount,  on T-bills or whatever. But then there’s a huge amount of cash. 50% to 70% of the   Page 21 portfolio  is  just  held  in  cash. And  that  cash  obviously,  can  be  held  in  T-bills  or  high  interest  savings accounts or other types of strategies to generate a yield on it. So what I’m showing here for all of these different strategies is just the excess returns. So the excess returns,  in excess of cash. We did the same thing for the SG Trend Index in blue. That SG Trend Index is the performance of the Trend Index in excess of  what  you  would  have  gotten  from  investing  in  cash,  all  right?

 for  comparison  purposes,  okay? The light blue line at the top is the combo, the 50/50 combo replication  strategy,  net  of  our  estimated  fees,  sorry,  commissions  and  slippage,  but  no  fees.   All right, now, we do make the case that very few people will be able to run this strategy on their own with no fees. They’ll  probably  have  to  allocate  to  some  kind  of  product  or  something, in  order  to  get exposure to it. So we just took a 1% fee, as maybe a standard fee for other types of funds like this that are out there. And so the black line is the replication strategy, net of expected slippage and commissions and net of a 1% fee. The  blue  line  Is the excess return trajectory for the SG Trend Index. One of the complications here is that the index itself is a combination of funds. Each of those funds charge a slightly different fee, and they almost all charge performance fees. The performance fees are charged typically after they reach a high  water  mark. Different  funds  are  going  to  reach  high  water  marks  at  different  times. Different investors who invested in those funds are going to hit high water marks at different times. And so we’re not, it’s not like you can just run a 2 and 20 overlay on the net replication strategy,  and basically get the same returns as the, as the underlying index because all of the underlying funds have charged their own performance fees at very different times along the way.  So in order to illustrate how well the strategy tracks the underlying index, we just ran the Replication Strategy, but, where we set the Sharpe ratio of the Replication Strategy to be equal to the Sharpe ratio of the SG Trend Index, over all rolling three year periods, right? So the yellow line there is really just to illustrate how well the Strategy mimics the character of the SG Trend Index. It is not meant to sort of illustrate any sort of performance expectations.

that clear or did you guys want to have... Rodrigo: 01:20:00 No, that was clear. I think we were talking about this internally. When you don’t include a fee, it just seems like it’s really tough to tell how well we did, right, with this experiment. It’s just a matter of, okay, how do we get the results that we got and be able to visually show that indeed, we are doing a pretty good job using these techniques, of replicating the index that we want. It’s all it is.  Adam: 01:20:25 Exactly. Maybe just scroll down to the performance table. So first of all, remember, the goal here is to track the index, right? So in reality, the actual performance is less important than how well the strategy correlates to the SG Trend Index. So you can see in fact that we get a correlation of about .86 which is pretty  high. The,   if  you  look  at  the  live  correlation  for  some  of  the  other  replication  ETFs,   their correlation is quite a bit lower than that. Right? And in fact, what we do observe, I don’t discuss this in   Page 22 the paper, but I can just discuss it live here, is that the correlation of the Replication Strategy has actually been higher in the recent period than in the distant,  past period. So in fact our tracking seems to get a little bit better over time, at least empirically in what we’re able to observe. I’m convinced that the majority of the improvement in annualized returns that we see, right, the difference between sort of 8, 9% excess returns versus just shy of 5% excess returns for the SG Trend index,  is mostly just that fee delta,  right? There’s no performance fees and even a 1% fee is lower than the typical 2% management fee that most futures funds charge. So that gap there, that, call it 3% gap, is approximately the fee alpha that you might be able to potentially capture if you were to allocate to this in a low fee tracking structure instead of

Rodrigo: 01:22:20 Very well said. Yeah, so that’s basically it on the paper. The link is included in the top of the chat and it’s included  in  the  show  notes  and  YouTube  and  in  your  favorite  podcast  listener. You  can  always  go  to Investresolve.com to download it as well. And yeah, we hope it was educational, useful, made you think about  the  concept  of  replication  in  a  unique  way. Is  there  anything  else  that  we  didn’t  cover,  Mike, Adam, that we think we need to cover here? Mike: 01:22:54 No, I’m not... Adam: 01:22:57 Someone asked the about the impact of slippage and commissions. I want to say that that was a little over 1%. About one and a half percent was what came out because of commissions and and slippage. Estimate. Estimates.  Rodrigo: 01:23:08 If you really want to get your hands dirty at the end of the paper, there’s an appendix that goes into the different   regression   approaches   that   were   taken,   and   get   into   more   nitty   gritty   detail   there.   Mike: 01:23:22 Yeah, I would say, yeah. We’re welcome for more feedback. This was, as we mentioned at the outset, is hot, hot, hot off the press. And so we're looking forward to more feedback and more discussions on the paper to dig into the areas where people might be unclear, want more details and those types of things. So it is launch day one, I guess, is it? Where yes...  Rodrigo: 01:23:47 Do reach out to ask questions, please.  Adam: 01:23:52 Like and Share the paper around.

AROUND CORNERS: TREND-FOLLOWING HOW TO REPLICATE MANAGED FUTURES www.investresolve.com Whitepaper Peering Around Corners: How to Replicate Trend-Following Managed Futures 2 ReSolve Asset Management SEZC (Cayman) Trend-following managed futures can be an excellent complement to traditional stocks and bonds. This paper explores the construction of a strategy to replicate the returns to a popular managed futures index. By using a replicating strategy that captures the broad exposures to equities, fixed income, commodities, and currencies that are present in the index while also identifying the underlying strategies used by trend-following managed futures funds, the authors produce a replication strategy that accurately captures the performance and character of the category. The replication strategy exceeds a 0.85 correlation with the benchmark index, suggesting that the representative models span most of the models used in the index. Investors who can access the Replication strategy at lower fees than the average managed futures fund may experience stronger net returns due to fee alpha. ABSTRACT Peering Around Corners: How to Replicate Trend-Following Managed Futures 3 ReSolve Asset Management SEZC (Cayman) PEERING AROUND CORNERS: HOW TO REPLICATE TREND-FOLLOWING MANAGED FUTURES In finance, it is common to explain the returns of a market, fund, or index using other securities, markets, funds, factors, and  so  on. This  type  of  modeling  serves  several  potential  purposes. The  Capital  Asset  Pricing  Model  (CAPM)  aimed  to explain  the  returns  of  an  equity  portfolio  by  finding  the  portfolio's  sensitivity  to  the  market  portfolio. Fama  and  French's groundbreaking paper, \"The Cross Section of Expected Stock Returns,\" attempted to improve on the CAPM by introducing factors related to firm size and book-to-market (value).

Returns Based Style Analysis (RBSA) regression produces weights of explanatory factors that, when held in a portfolio, would track the return of the target strategy. If the selected factors effectively explain the target strategy, the tracking portfolio should closely follow the target strategy's path. Any returns exceeding what the tracking portfolio would be anticipated to produce are considered alpha. For example, Frazzini, Kabiller, and Pedersen (2013) 1 found that Warren Buffett's historical returns in excess of the returns to the S&P 500 could be explained by his use of cheap, safe, high-quality stocks combined with consistent leverage. The pursuit of alpha is the ultimate goal of active management, and many investors dedicate their entire careers to it. REPLICATING HEDGE FUND RETURNS There  are  some  investors  who  are  not  interested  in  alpha,  or  who  feel  they  do  not  possess  the  skills  or  access  to  find consistent alpha. They may believe that while markets are not perfectly efficient, many inefficiencies can be explained by well-defined risks and other effects that can be harvested using simple rules. In the past, these inefficiencies powered the alpha of active mutual funds and hedge funds. However, academics and practitioners have since demystified these sources of return and have begun offering exposure to them through public indices at much lower fees. As a result, products that capture these inefficiencies are now available to investors as alternative betas, rather than as sources of alpha for active managers. Smart beta products that seek exposure to value, momentum, quality, low volatility, or size effects are examples of these quasi-passive strategies. Some  hedge  fund  strategies  use  securities  and  techniques  that  are  not  well-suited  to  investment  structures  that  are accessible  to  all  investors. However,  regulatory  frameworks  can  evolve  over  time,  such  that  strategies  that  were  once impossible to democratize may become feasible down the road.

MANAGED FUTURES Trend-following managed futures is a hedge-fund strategy that involves trading futures contracts in various financial markets, such as commodities, currencies, and stock and bond indices, with the aim of identifying and capitalizing on trends in these markets. This strategy has its roots in the dawn of liquid futures markets in the 1970s and a number of the firms that trade in this style have been around for decades, with well established track records. 1 Frazzini, A., Kabiller, D., & Pedersen, L.

For instance, while information propagates at an ever-faster rate over time, market complexity also increases. As a result, it takes some time for investors to reach a consensus on the expected direction of markets 2 . As investors move to add or withdraw capital from markets, this triggers a change in price that takes time to evolve 3 . There is also research to suggest that investors underreact to changes in market conditions near turning points, and then overreact to large price moves, pushing prices far beyond fundamentals 4 . Markets  have  historically  produced  persistent  trends  that  managed  futures  strategies  can  profit  from. Because  trend- following strategies can trade both long and short across many markets, they have historically produced returns with low correlation to major stock and bond benchmarks, making them an excellent diversifying strategy for traditional portfolios.

BTOP 50 returns are sourced from Barclay Hedge. Past performance does not guarantee future results. Note that the Barclay BTOP 50 Index, proxying the net performance of trend-following managed futures strategies, has produced  returns  that  are  competitive  with  stock  and  bond  benchmarks  over  the  past  three  decades,  based  on  the information contained in Table 1. Monthly volatility is about twice that of bonds and half the volatility of stocks, and the BTOP 50 Index has exhibited a lower correlation to both stocks and bonds than we observe between stocks and bonds. As a result, managed futures are often considered an ideal complement to traditional portfolios. Peering Around Corners: How to Replicate Trend-Following Managed Futures 6 ReSolve Asset Management SEZC (Cayman) DISPERSION IN TREND-FOLLOWING MANAGED FUTURES FUND RETURNS On average, based on the low historical average correlations exhibited in Table 2, trend-following managed futures funds have historically been an attractive diversifier for traditional portfolios of stocks and bonds. However, while the Barclay BTOP Index and other common indices of trend-following funds are typically constituted with investable funds, few allocators will operationalize an allocation to all of the underlying managers. Rather, most investors choose to allocate to just one fund or perhaps a small sample of funds. This may be problematic for those seeking category-like returns most years.

because there is a great deal of variation in how funds express a  trend-following  strategy. Funds  may  choose  different  universes  of  markets  to  trade,  utilize  different  trend  lengths  and definitions,  apply  different  weighting  schemes,  use  different  risk  management  techniques  and  stop-losses,  or  include exposures  to  other  systematic  factors  like  carry. As  a  result,  the  returns  to  trend-following  managed  futures  funds  can exhibit large dispersion from year-to-year. Figure 2. Total return dispersion by calendar year for a representative universe of public trend-following managed futures funds.   Source:  Funds  were  selected  from  the  Morningstar  Systematic  Trend  category. Funds  with  less  than  five  years  of  continuous  data through January 2023 were excluded. Funds used (by ticker symbol) include ABYIX, ACXIX, AHLIX, AMFNX, AQMIX, CSAIX, EQCHX, EVOIX, GMSSX, LCSIX, LFMIX, LOTIX, MFTNX, PQTIX, QMHIX, RYIFX, SUPIX, WAVIX. Past performance does not guarantee future results. The  violin  plot  with  box  and  whisker  in  Figure  2  illustrates  how,  in  most  years,  returns  to  trend-following  funds  tend  to cluster together with a few outliers. A violin plot is a type of graph that is used to show the distribution of a dataset and looks like a shape that is similar to a violin. The wide part of the shape shows where there are more data points, and the narrow part shows where there are fewer data points.

Around Corners: How to Replicate Trend-Following Managed Futures 7 ReSolve Asset Management SEZC (Cayman) Over the five years from 2018 through 2022 the returns to individual trend-following managed futures funds 5 deviated from the average of all funds 5 by 9 percentage points about half the time. The 95 percent range of dispersion was almost 27 percentage  points. This  dispersion  motivates  a  search  for  methods  to  gain  exposure  to  the  underlying  theme  of  trend- following with minimal tracking error. REPLICATING TREND-FOLLOWING MANAGED FUTURES Replication strategies seek to deliver a return experience that closely tracks the return trajectory of a target benchmark. Which prompts the question: What is the most appropriate trend-following managed futures benchmark? Strategy replication is at root a data science exercise. While it is critical to understand the underlying mechanics of the target index, the quality of any replication model will ultimately depend on the number of data points available to generate a good fit. While the BTOP 50 Index is representative of trend-following managed futures strategies, and publishes monthly returns back to the late 1980s, the index only started publishing daily returns data in 2010. This is not ideal for replication. The SG Trend Index, managed by Société Générale,  tracks the 10 largest (by AUM) trend-following managed futures funds, and is representative of the trend-follower niche in the managed futures space. The SG Trend Index is equally weighted, and rebalanced and reconstituted annually. And the index publishes daily returns back to January 1 st , 2000. To be included in the index, managers must meet the following criteria: • Must be open to new investment • Must report daily returns • Must be an industry recognized trend-follower as determined at the discretion of the SG Index Committee • Must exhibit significant correlation to trend-following peers and the SG Trend Indicator In an ideal world, a replication strategy would have access to the actual holdings and trading in the funds that constitute the index.

a result, replication strategies must infer the weighted average holdings of the managers that constitute the benchmark strictly from an understanding of the types of markets that managed futures funds typically trade, the kinds of strategies they typically employ, and reported index returns. There are two general approaches to index replication. The first, which we’ll label “top down” replication, involves using the returns over the past few days or weeks to solve for the underlying average holdings of managers in the index at each point in time. The latter, which we’ll call “bottom-up” replication, seeks to uncover the underlying strategies that funds in the index are using to form portfolios. Once we uncover the weighting to a representative basket of underlying strategies, we can run the strategies forward to determine index level holdings at each point in time. 5 Funds included in the analysis include ABYIX, ACXIX, AHLIX, AMFNX, AQMIX, CSAIX, EQCHX, EVOIX, GMSSX, LCSIX, LFMIX, LOTIX, MFTNX, PQTIX, QMHIX, RYIFX, SUPIX, WAVIX. Peering Around Corners: How to Replicate Trend-Following Managed Futures 8 ReSolve Asset Management SEZC (Cayman) DATA Daily  returns  of  the  Trend  Index  were  downloaded  from  Société  Générale  Prime  Services 6 .  Futures  market  data  is  from CSI Data and Refinitiv. Futures total returns include price returns and roll returns but not collateral yield, so they represent excess returns above the borrowing rate. Two  investment  universes  were  utilized  for  modeling  purposes. The  “medium”  sized  universe  contains  27  liquid  futures markets  representing  equity  and  bond  indices,  major  currency  crosses  with  the  USD,  along  with  energy  and  metal commodities.

TOP-DOWN REPLICATION If we were replicating Warren Buffett’s portfolio, the top-down approach would be akin to trying to identify the portfolio of stocks that best replicates his returns by regressing his track record on the universe of stocks. While Warren Buffett famously holds positions for decades, positions in trend-following managed futures funds can change rapidly. As a result, the replicating portfolio must be fit at each daily time-step, using returns to the index and the explanatory markets over the preceding days and weeks. Each model fit yields weights for a portfolio of representative markets which, if held over the term of the regression, minimize the squared difference between tracking portfolio returns and benchmark returns. 6 https://wholesale.banking.societegenerale.com/en/prime-services-indices/ Peering Around Corners: How to Replicate Trend-Following Managed Futures 9 ReSolve Asset Management SEZC (Cayman) Top-down replication is complicated by several factors. There is considerable diversity in the universe of markets traded in different funds, so exposures to underlying markets in the index is a function of the number of managers in the index that trade each market. The average holding period of positions is also not known, and this is further complicated by the fact that each position is rebalanced based on its own signals, which may or may not coincide with rebalancing of other markets on a given day. In the academic literature, there are numerous approaches proposed for modeling dynamic portfolios 7 , but this paper will focus on a method that utilizes robust linear regression. Elastic Net regression 8 was selected for top-down models because this  modeling  approach  identifies  the  most  important  markets  at  play  in  each  period,  while  simultaneously  penalizing models that concentrate too heavily in any single market.

For illustrative purposes only. First,  the  returns  for  each  market  are  scaled  to  the  same  target  standard  deviation  using  a  rolling  40-day  exponentially weighted  moving  average  of  past  returns. Then  each  day,  the  returns  to  the  Trend  index  were  regressed  on  the  scaled returns of the universe of explanatory markets to find the portfolio that best matches the returns to the index. Individual 7 Recurrent neural networks, long-short-term-memory models, and Kalman filter regressions appear well suited to the problem because they explicitly capture the fact that yesterday’s portfolio carries information about the likely constituents of today’s portfolio. However, these models are burdened by other complexities that render them ill-suited for modeling trend-following managed futures strategies. In particular, since portfolios turn over every few weeks, the number of parameters that must be optimized in each model is large relative to the number of data points available for each fit. 8 See Appendix – Robust Regression Primer for details on Elastic Net, LASSO and Ridge regression methods. Peering Around Corners: How to Replicate Trend-Following Managed Futures 10 ReSolve Asset Management SEZC (Cayman) Elastic Net models were fit using rolling returns over each of the past 20, 25, 30, 35 and 40 days 9 . Finally, a linear model was fit on the output of the models fit at each lookback to determine the weights of the individual models in the final model.

larger universe  of  markets  may  explain  a  larger  proportion  of  index  returns,  but  the  regression  becomes  less  reliable  as  the number of explanatory variables becomes large relative to the number of observations used for the fit. A smaller universe may not span the full opportunity set available to managers in the index, but may produce more stable results given that there are at most 40 observations available for each fit. Two representative baskets of explanatory markets were selected. A smaller basket consisted of 9 markets that represented broad exposures to equities, fixed income, commodities, and currencies. A larger basket included 27 markets with more granular exposures to the same sectors. When the weights at each time period were fitted using Elastic Net regression, a similar quality fit and performance over time were produced by both the small and large universes. However, periods of better and worse fit were exhibited during different periods, so that a better tracking portfolio was produced by combining the models than was observed by either model on its own. Figure 5. Cumulative equity of Top-Down Trend Replication strategy GROSS excess returns, January 31 st , 1990 – January 31 st , 2023. SIMULATED RESULTS.  THESE  RESULTS  ARE  BASED  ON  SIMULATED  OR  HYPOTHETICAL  PERFORMANCE. You  should  not  take  SIMULATED  OR HYPOTHETICAL performance as an indication of actual or future performance. Please see below for Important Information regarding SIMULATED OR HYPOTHETICAL performance. Source: Futures data is from Refinitiv. Analysis performed by ReSolve Global. Simulation returns are total returns including roll yield, in excess of the funding rate and gross of slippage, commissions, and fees. 9 Lambda, the parameter that specifies the multiplier on the penalty function, was selected on the basis of the full-sample Sharpe ratio of returns generated from rolling regressions at each lookback horizon.

Asset Management SEZC (Cayman) BOTTOM-UP REPLICATION If the top-down approach is akin to trying to figure out which stocks Warren Buffett owns, the bottom-up approach is akin to trying to figure out which characteristics Warren Buffett uses to pick stocks. Bottom-up replication is aimed at uncovering the underlying strategies that funds in the index are using to form portfolios. A combination of time-series momentum, price versus moving average, multiple moving average, or breakout systems are typically employed in trend-following strategies to identify market trends. Trend-following  managed  futures  funds  may  trade  trends  that  evolve  over  lookback  periods  from  a  few  weeks  to  a  few years. Thirteen representative trend trading strategies were selected with lookbacks over representative time windows 10 . Specifically, trends were measured using total return 11 divided by standard deviation at each lookback to produce a z-score. The position in each market for each trend strategy was then a product of the z-score and the expected volatility of that market based on trailing 40 day exponentially weighted historical standard deviation. This produced 13 trend strategies x 27 markets = 351 combinations of market/strategy pairs. A Ridge regression model was fit using the returns from these 351 strategies so that when the strategies were traded as a  portfolio  in  the  weights  prescribed  by  the  model,  there  was  minimal  difference  between  the  returns  of  the  replication portfolio and the index returns. Model weights were constrained to be long-only. Ridge regression was chosen over LASSO or Elastic Net because Ridge regression is well-suited for identifying all the relevant predictors, even if some of them may be false positives. Given that the strategies employed in trend-following funds are well documented in the literature, emphasis was placed on ensuring the inclusion of all relevant models at the expense of potentially including models that were used less frequently by trend-following managers. K-fold cross-validation was used to assess whether strategy exposures change over time. Specifically, models were fitted on 90% of the data, and the selected strategies were run on the remaining 10% of the data.

were then combined to simulate performance over the full history of the SG Trend Index. In addition, models were also fit on the full data sample, and the selected strategies were run on the full data set to generate a full simulation based on in-sample fit. To compare the performance of the two simulations, the returns from both were scaled to the same target volatility using rolling 40-day exponentially weighted standard deviation. The out-of-sample simulation performed similarly to the simulation based on the entire data set, with a daily Pearson correlation of 0.997, suggesting models fit to the full dataset should be well calibrated to track the index in the future. The selected strategies were also largely consistent across sub-samples, indicating that trend-following futures managers have been consistent with the strategies and core markets traded over time. 10 Trend strategies were run on each market with lookbacks of 5, 10, 15, 20, 30, 40, 60, 90, 120, 180 and 260 trading days. The returns to these strategies were then used to explain the returns of the SG Trend Index. 11 Price return plus roll return.

0.8 correlation with the SG Trend Index, suggesting that the representative models span most of the models used in the index. It is useful to examine which strategies were selected to best model the returns of the Trend Index. All the markets were selected for inclusion, and financial markets like currencies, equity and bond indices had greater weight than commodities. It was especially interesting to observe the weights that trend managers appear to express in trend strategies of different lookbacks. In aggregate, trend managers appear not to trade trends with lookbacks less than 30 days, and 98 percent of the weighting of selected strategies loaded on trend lookbacks of 90 days or greater. The models also imply that trend managers on average assign monotonically increasing weight to longer trend strategies. Peering Around Corners: How to Replicate Trend-Following Managed Futures 13 ReSolve Asset Management SEZC (Cayman) Figure  7. Total  trend  system  weights  in  the  bottom-up  trend  replication  strategy  sorted  on  trend  lookbacks  in  days, January 4 th , 2000 – January 31 st , 2023  Source: Data from Refinitiv. Analysis by ReSolve Global. FINAL REPLICATION STRATEGY The  top-down  and  bottom-up  strategies  both  create  efficient  tracking  portfolios,  each  with  its  own  strengths  and weaknesses. While the top-down approach had a slightly inferior fit compared to the bottom-up method, it displayed a lower tracking error during crucial times in the historical data. Conversely, the bottom-up approach achieved a superior fit  and  overall  performance,  but  it  raises  the  concern  that  future  managers  may  implement  new  strategies  that  are  not represented by the replication strategies used. By combining the two methods, the final replication strategy can balance the strengths and weaknesses of both approaches and create a tracking portfolio that is both accurate and stable. The top-down and bottom-up strategies are not perfectly correlated, so a combination produced higher performance than either approach on its own.

the methods also improves the long-term correlation between replication and benchmark returns. The final Replication strategy gives 50% weight to the bottom-up replication and 50% weight to the top-down strategy. The top-down strategy gives equal risk weight to the replication on the small universe of markets, and 50% weight to the replication on the large universe. Both the bottom-up and top-down replication weights are first scaled to target 20 percent long-term average volatility so that the combination accrues 50 percent of risk from each strategy. The combined weights are then smoothed using a 5-day exponential moving average to optimize trading frictions. Figure 8 compares the performance character of the Replication strategy against the SG Trend Index. Note that the SG Trend Index is net of all costs including management fees and performance fees while the Replication strategy is net of estimated trading commissions and slippage but gross of all fees (“Net Replication strategy”). While large institutions may Peering Around Corners: How to Replicate Trend-Following Managed Futures 14 ReSolve Asset Management SEZC (Cayman) be  able  to  implement  the  Replication  strategy  internally  for  nominal  cost,  many  investors  would  expect  to  pay  a  fee  for access to the strategy. A version of the Net Replication strategy less a representative 1 percent annual fee is also provided for illustration. Note that we deducted the return on T-bills from the SG Trend Index returns to be consistent with the returns of the Replication strategies, which are also net of cash returns. In an effort to illustrate how the Replication strategy tracks the return trajectory of the SG Trend Index over time, a Sharpe Parity Replication strategy was created by scaling the returns of the Net Replication strategy to equal the Sharpe ratio of the Trend Index over all rolling 3-year periods. This preserves most of the correlation character of the Replication strategy relative to the Trend Index but aligns the equity lines in the chart to gain a better understanding of how the Replication strategy tracks the index. As we can see from Figure 8, the Replication strategy equity line is very similar to the SG Trend Index, implying that the Replication strategy is a close proxy for investment in the benchmark Index.

Please see below for Important Information regarding SIMULATED OR HYPOTHETICAL performance. Source: Futures data is from Refinitiv. Analysis by ReSolve Global. Simulation returns are total returns including roll yield, in excess of the funding rate. NET REPLICATION is net of estimated trade slippage and commissions, but gross of all fees. NET REPLICATION @ 1% FEE is net of estimated trade slippage and commissions, and a 1% annual fee charged daily. SG Trend Index returns are net of all transaction costs and fees, and in excess of the 3-month US Treasury bill yield. Some of you may be wondering how the Net Replication strategy would have performed if it had been subject to the same fees as the funds in the SG Trend Index. To compare apples to apples, we calculated the returns for the Net Replication strategy after subtracting a 2% management fee and a 20% performance fee charged quarterly (2 & 20). In simulation, the Net Replication strategy earned an annualized excess return of 9.13% before fees, from the inception of the SG Trend Index on January 31 st , 2000 through January 31 st , 2023. After taking fees into account, the Net Replication strategy produced an annualized excess return of 5.59%, which is higher than the 4.65% annualized excess returns of the SG Trend Index over the same time period.

strategy net of 2 & 20 fees suggests the possibility of fee alpha. This means that by removing the fees charged by funds in the index, the Net Replication strategy has the potential to generate higher returns. CONCLUSION In  this  paper,  we  have  explored  two  replication  methods  for  trend-following  benchmark  indices  and  evaluated  their effectiveness in creating tracking portfolios that accurately capture the performance of the index. Our analysis reveals that both  top-down  and  bottom-up  replication  methods  can  create  efficient  tracking  portfolios,  each  with  its  own  strengths and  weaknesses. The  bottom-up  replication  method  aims  to  uncover  the  underlying  strategies  used  by  trend-following managed futures funds to form portfolios, while the top-down replication method identifies the most important markets at play in each period. Peering Around Corners: How to Replicate Trend-Following Managed Futures 16 ReSolve Asset Management SEZC (Cayman) We find that the final Replication strategy, which gives 50% weight to the bottom-up replication and 50% weight to the top- down replication, strikes a reasonable balance between accuracy and stability. By combining the two methods, the strategy has been able to capture the broad exposures to equities, fixed income, commodities, and currencies that are present in the index while also identifying the underlying strategies used by trend-following managed futures funds. Moreover, our analysis shows that the set of model/market pairs selected by the modeling process produced a replication strategy that exceeds a 0.85 correlation with the SG Trend Index, suggesting that the representative models span most of the models used in the index. Overall,  our  findings  indicate  that  trend-following  replication  strategies  have  good  potential  to  track  the  performance  of benchmark trend indices while also outperforming the index over the long-term due to lower fees. By using a combination of  top-down  and  bottom-up  replication  methods,  investors  can  create  tracking  portfolios  that  accurately  capture  the performance of the index while also minimizing

APPENDIX - ROBUST REGRESSION: A PRIMER In statistical modeling, bias and variance are two important concepts that reflect the quality of the model. Bias refers to the difference between the expected value of the model's predictions and the true value of the outcome being predicted. A model is said to be biased if it consistently overestimates or underestimates the true value of the outcome. On the other hand, variance refers to the amount by which the model's predictions vary for different training sets. A model with high variance is sensitive to small fluctuations in the training data, which can lead to overfitting and poor generalization to new data. The bias-variance tradeoff is the balancing act that is required when developing a statistical model. A model that is too simple may have low variance but high bias, which means that it consistently underestimates or overestimates the true value of the outcome. Conversely, a model that is too complex may have low bias but high variance, which means that it fits the training data very closely but may not generalize well to new data. Finding the right balance between bias and variance is crucial to developing a model that is accurate and generalizable. Type 1 and Type 2 errors are also important concepts in statistical modeling, particularly in hypothesis testing. A Type 1 error occurs when a null hypothesis is rejected even though it is actually true. In other words, the hypothesis test incorrectly concludes that there is a significant effect when there is not. A Type 2 error occurs when a null hypothesis is not rejected even though it is actually false. In other words, the hypothesis test incorrectly concludes that there is no significant effect when there is one. The  tradeoff  between  Type  1  and  Type  2  errors  is  another  balancing  act  that  is  required  when  conducting  hypothesis testing. Reducing the risk of one type of error often increases the risk of the other type of error. For example, lowering the significance level of a hypothesis test (thereby reducing the risk of a Type 1 error) will increase the risk of a Type 2 error.

tasks. When predictors are highly correlated, as is often the case in real-world data, OLS regression can result in Peering Around Corners: How to Replicate Trend-Following Managed Futures 17 ReSolve Asset Management SEZC (Cayman) unstable coefficient estimates and a lack of interpretability in the model. OLS regression is more prone to overfitting, which occurs when the model is too complex and fits the training data too closely. Overfitting can lead to poor performance on new data and reduced interpretability. Also, OLS regression includes all predictors in the model, even those that may not be relevant or significant. Ridge regression, LASSO regression, and Elastic Net regression are robust regression techniques that overcome many of the weaknesses of traditional OLS regression. These techniques use regularization, which adds a penalty term to the regression objective function to allow data scientists to more explicitly manage the tradeoff between bias and variance, and Type 1 and Type 2 error in statistical modeling. Ridge regression introduces a penalty term that adds a multiple of the L2-norm of the coefficients to the objective function. This penalty term shrinks the coefficient estimates towards zero, reducing the variance of the estimates and minimizing overfitting. Ridge regression can help to reduce the Type 2 error rate, which means it can help to identify true predictors that  are  correlated  with  the  outcome. However,  Ridge  regression  has  the  potential  to  introduce  bias  into  the  coefficient estimates, as it may underfit by shrinking them towards zero. LASSO regression introduces a penalty term that adds a multiple of the L1-normof the coefficients to the objective function. This penalty term forces some of the coefficients to be exactly zero, effectively performing variable selection. LASSO can help to reduce the risk of overfitting and reduce the number of predictors in the model, but it can also introduce bias into the coefficient estimates. Specifically, small perturbations in sample data may prompt LASSO models to select very different sets of predictors.

truly significant and not false positives. Elastic Net regression combines Ridge and LASSO regression by adding a penalty term that is a weighted sum of Ridge and LASSO penalties. This penalty term can help to reduce both the Type 1 and Type 2 error rates and provide a better balance between bias and variance. Elastic Net can help to reduce the risk of overfitting, and also reduce the number of predictors in the model. The choice of whether to employ Ridge, LASSO or Elastic Net regression depends on a number of factors. If a modeler is concerned about selecting too narrow a set of predictors, or that an effect may not be stable across samples, Ridge regression may be preferred. If a modeler is confident of stable effects and is more concerned with selecting a subset of predictors, LASSO regression may make more sense. If a modeler is uncertain about the stability of model effects and has no preference for Type 1 or Type 2 error, then Elastic Net may be optimal. In summary, Ridge regression, LASSO regression, and Elastic Net regression all manage the tradeoff between bias and variance by using regularization. Ridge regression can help to reduce the Type 2 error rate and prevent overfitting, but may introduce bias. LASSO regression can help to reduce the Type 1 error rate and perform variable selection, but may also introduce excess variance. Elastic Net regression sometimes provides a better balance between bias and variance and can help to reduce both Type 1 and Type 2 error rates.

Important information regarding SIMULATED OR HYPOTHETICAL performance and results. SIMULATED OR HYPOTHETICAL RESULTS HAVE CERTAIN INHERENT LIMITATIONS. UNLIKE THE RESULTS SHOWN IN AN ACTUAL PERFORMANCE  RECORD,  THESE  RESULTS  DO  NOT  REPRESENT  ACTUAL  TRADING. ALSO,  BECAUSE  THESE  TRADES  HAVE NOT ACTUALLY BEEN EXECUTED, THESE RESULTS MAY HAVE UNDER OR OVER-COMPENSATED FOR THE IMPACT, IF ANY, OF CERTAIN MARKET FACTORS, SUCH AS LACK OF LIQUIDITY. SIMULATED OR HYPOTHETICAL TRADING PROGRAMS IN GENERAL ARE  ALSO  SUBJECT  TO  THE  FACT  THAT  THEY  ARE  DESIGNED  WITH  THE  BENEFIT  OF  HINDSIGHT. PAST  PERFORMANCE (WHETHER ACTUAL OR HYPOTHETICAL) IS NOT INDICATIVE OF FUTURE PERFORMANCE.
